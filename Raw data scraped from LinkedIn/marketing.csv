I ensure consistency in brand voice and image in marketing and social media messages by working with the designer and the business development team.

",11,2020,"Listening, writing and curating stories of brands ","When I was a child, my Grandpa used to tell me stories about his youth. How he ran away from his house at a young age, made a living and was friends with movie stars. His stories made my day and I would share them with my friends. Soon, I became the stories guy. The key is attentive listening. 

I love to megaphone the stories of brands so they can align with the stories of people. I am a brand communication enthusiast with 3 years of work experience in Content and Social Media Marketing. Working with fast-paced agencies in client-facing roles gave me the skills to forge and strengthen stakeholder engagements. Listening and understanding the client’s project brief before sitting down with my team was the key part of my role. 

I have worked on social media marketing strategies, Employee communication and advertising projects for brands from different industries (technology, hospitality, FMCG and logistics). Using social media platforms to drive engagement toward a brand’s page has been my forte and passion. 

This passion lacked evidence-based knowledge and to fulfil that I pursued my master’s in marketing at The Australian National University. Here I studied courses like Strategic Management, Global Marketing and Brand Strategy. However, learning is beyond the walls of the classroom, so  I engaged in business competitions, event management and other professional development programs. This is when I learnt that there is truly so much more to learn. 

My love for stories continues with all the work I do. I cannot turn off the eye for a good story. I am always the one who asks, ‘What was going on in the mind of the team?’ when looking at a logo or an ad or even a picture. 

I want to be a part of that team weaving a brand's story. So, I am actively looking for any opportunities in the field of marketing and communication. This could be the next chapter of my story.

He also pushed the idea of products being intuitive. He hated learning curves and always found ways to adapt the product to the user and not the other way around. This idea stayed in my mind when I first read his biography, and always comes back to me whenever I am writing or designing something.
I love writing. Whether it is an article or an email or even a shopping list. I format my words in a manner that is intuitive and relatable. I do not write in a manner that appeals to everyone, but I tend to write in a manner that everybody understands.

I summarize results and curate reports generated by SEngine apps for oncologists, clinical trials, internal research projects, and outside collaborators. I regularly review scientific and medical literature concerning newly developed oncology drugs to be employed in PARIS® tests.  My long-standing knowledge of cancer signaling pathways and understanding of genomics has placed me on a unique position to integrate results with in-depth cancer genomics, cancer biology, large data-set analysis and individual patient clinical data.
Previously I was a postdoc in Dr. Peter Nelson’s lab in FHCRC. My research interest focused on DNA damage repair in prostate cancer particularly HR deficiency and PARP inhibitor context. I was also interested in role of prostate tumor microenvironment in therapy resistance and how you can manipulate and overcome the resistance. All of my previous publications involved DNA damage response pathway effect especially non homologous end-joining following PARP inhibition and different radiation treatment like brachytherapy, gamma radiation in prostate cancer. In recent study I am focusing on effectiveness of supraphysiological androgen as a treatment opportunity in AR dependent prostate cancer, specifically in DNA damage repair deficient subgroups. 
 Before that I have successfully defended my Thesis, entitled “DNA Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer Cells in Response to Radiation”. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is prevalent in ~60% of prostate cancer patients. Using PARP inhibitor rucaparib (Clovis, originally by Pfizer) along with radiation exhibited synergic lethality in prostate cancer cells. I have also demonstrated that TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene induces DNA damage and DNA repair is defective in these cells.",Cleveland Clinic/ Kent State University,Doctoral Degree,2008,2014,Cell & Molecular biology focused on cancer biology,426,2

Then, because of these experiences, software seemed magical for me.
