But  one's ability  is just limitless as I always believed and then there  foot prints on the moon. Would any day try out opportunity  that excites me,  take new challenges, meet new people, ask questions - I am curious, target driven, tenacious & focused. Graduated from VIT University with Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, got placed in reputed IT firms which I knew wasn’t my cup of tea (Coffee helps me when my brain needs a hug). I took up Sales which was highly challenging and did seem like what I really wanted to do. This job would definitely be part of my lesson on entrepreneurship as well.
   
24/7 is the time I work best and  am a trained all-nighter believing dreams should be something which doesn’t make you sleep. Tennis & running keeps me pumped up all day  which makes my hobby. Never give up attitude has taken me so far.  Still seeking to learn more everyday and exploring more opportunities where I could use the knowledge I have rendered in few courses I have done. I don’t mind getting my hands dirty as long as learning is part of it . I have organized events, performed, anchored, auditioned and more. 

As for sales I am driven by tips and support from many mentors who are professionals in this field. I wouldn’t regard selling a product an achievement rather a customer’s smile when I have  their appointment or a smile from a cold call. The product selling will come along.

As a professional, I am pursuing content writing and digital marketing with nascent ventures. 
I believe that quality stands above the quantum of the content. The right content has the power of generating good organic traffic and such traffic has a better conversion rate than inorganic for any venture. Therefore, I focus on making my writing skills quirky, creative, solid and on-point so that crisper contents can be delivered to the target audience.

Throughout my career, I have been driven by my intellectual curiosity to find answers to the most pressing questions. As a child, I recall annoying my physicist dad asking him a ""why so?"" every time he came up with ""Everything happens for a reason and the reason is Physics"" perception. This curiosity made me take up a bachelor's degree in general physics and later a master's degree in physics.

With 1+ years of experience as a business intelligence analyst at two different companies, one completely on sales and the other on healthcare revenue management, I could understand the broader aspects of data driven business.

My intellectual curiosity also drives me to be lifelong learner. I am currently pursuing my second master's degree in Data analytics from National College of Ireland, Dublin. The projects that kept me busy and amused are enlisted in the projects section.

I enjoy travelling and eating my way around the world, reading national politics and talking about the future of mobile and automobile technologies. So If you ever want to bounce ideas off me, feel free to contact me: rite2barath@gmail.com.
