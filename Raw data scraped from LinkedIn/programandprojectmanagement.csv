Ever since I was a teenager, I tinkered with gadgets. It was my hobby, my passion, and my way of learning. Technology amazed me. As I grew up my interest in cars escalated. I had the urge to learn about the technology running behind them which particularly influenced me to take up mechanical engineering. I also love spend time solving online puzzles, problems and quizzes. At school level I participated in many Olympiads and won prizes. I Participated in SAE mini BAJA event in Rochester (New York) 2013 to represent our university as a member of the transmission and management team.
Engineering taught me that at both product and consulting firms the key to business operations of technology/engineering firms is the management of technology. A well rounded MBA program from MDI Gurgaon helped me to get an understanding of how processes happen within any firm.

After my MBA I joined Lava International limited as a Management Trainee at, where I understood how the sales and distribution network of a product works. I was stationed in Lucknow upcountry region as an Area Sales Manager and was responsible to implement strategies to expand the width of distribution of the product.

Post that I switched to American Express where I worked as a Business Analyst in the New Accounts Underwriting Team, where I managed New Accounts Underwriting Strategies for Amex Proprietary Business to increase the low-risk customer base and thus profitability.

Ever since then I started to work hard and smart, elevated the mindset, and enabled the forward momentum attitude.

Hi! I am Pankaj and I am passionate about LFC and storytelling

To be honest, when I was in college, the girl I dated supported Liverpool and that's how I began to support the club. 4 years forward, this club stayed and with developed interest, I began to study the history of the LFC. Knowledge of football, clubs, and different leagues helped me significantly after I graduated from college, moved cities, and started my professional career with Uber.

Getting into the character of an employee, I realized - In this company, there are folks coming in from different age groups and since football is constant across age groups, it became a lever for a great icebreaker that led to a smooth flow of conversation and that led to instant bond among employees.

Cut to - I survived the impact of the pandemic and continue to work with Uber for over 4 years now - gained experience in project management, program/ people management, operations, strategy & planning, and customer service - all these contributed to my role as Project Delivery Lead for India SA Region at Uber.

The client was originally a brick and mortar office that wanted to take their business online to enter the Pan US Market. Very specific business rules exist in this business vertical when it comes to credit score and security had to be a priority.

Handled a team of 8 onsite developers and testers (Sr. and Jr.) working in an incremental agile fashion to build, test, deploy and transfer the software to the end client.  

Client being new to the Tech space, requirements were mostly unorganized, random and non-linear, so had to work closely with our onshore coordinator to establish business rules, identify gaps, setup policies and defined scope as per the expectations of the client. 

Prevented scope creep from the client in between the development stages and restricted changes to the approved scope of the project. 

Worked extensively with onshore team to get the client acclimated to an offshore-onsite relationship and this was a critical piece in maintaining client relationship for company.  

Special emphasis has been put on communication to prevent unnecessary gaps between the team and the client. 

Developed the WBS and maintained project plan in MS Projects, and used Trello for task management and client ticket tracking.  

Involved all the concerned Stakeholders to their level of involvement and took their satisfaction as the top priority. 

Held daily status meetings with team and semi-weekly with the client, and nightly touch base with the onsite coordinator   

Setup DR Plan for the client, and held trial runs of software breakdown scenarios. 

Created a realistic schedule for the implementation of the project after discussing with the onsite and offshore teams and iterated accordingly to maximize efficiency and productivity. 

Special care has been taken to mitigate risks and eliminated the unnecessary risks with the help of Risk Register.

I realized my inclination for Construction Engineering when I along with few other trainees was assigned responsibility of monitoring the work of labours involved in constructing a post-tensioned slab. I read plans, prepared daily progress report and resolved issues on site. During that stint I imbibed skills needed to be a competent construction manager and realized how scheduling, planning and controlling of critical and non-critical activities is done on the site. I was equally excited to see the way resource allocation and resource levelling is done during the peak hours of a construction activity. I also got a clear picture of the way services are out-sourced at the site on contractual basis and the way money allocation is done. Most interesting part of my intern was the cost control and management which plays a vital role in a construction activity. CPM, PERT etc are some of the many theoretical aspects which although I had learnt in my college, but their actual applications were learnt by me in this internship. I also experienced working as part of a team in Leighton Welspun Contractors which I had experienced once in Larsen and Toubro, where I was working as an intern in the project of “Design of Super critical Boiler structure” for the boiler structure of Koradi and Nigrie Thermal power plants with many other graduate Engineers.

Application Development as a service is an unique concept conceptualised by Spinta Digital Inc. 

Application Development for your business, and bringing mobility solutions in to your business is an expensive affair.  Developing the App and launching it to the world, is just the first step of your goal.  What you need is constant support, analytics, business intelligent, marketing strategy suggestions based on analytics to be able to effectively reach you goal. 

What AppDAS offers is a App development as a service, so you start your app with a low upfront cost, and a monthly service cost. This would enable you to make sure that the application developer is more of a partner in your business process than a one time vendor, who develops the app that you need for a lump sum price, and has no interest in supporting or helping you to increase the efficiency of your business through the app.

At AppDAS we believe our growth should be linked to the growth of our customers.  We believe in being partners to our clients, where we want to support through out their goals for their app. 

We have a strong team with abundance of experience in developing apps for some of the leading companies across continents.  We have a strong analytics and marketing team to support you in taking your business to the next level through digital mediums and mobility.",Vellore Institute of Technology,Master of Technology - MTech,2006,2008,Information Technology,1191,2

Application Development as a service is an unique concept conceptualised by Spinta Digital Inc. 

Application Development for your business, and bringing mobility solutions in to your business is an expensive affair.  Developing the App and launching it to the world, is just the first step of your goal.  What you need is constant support, analytics, business intelligent, marketing strategy suggestions based on analytics to be able to effectively reach you goal. 

What AppDAS offers is a App development as a service, so you start your app with a low upfront cost, and a monthly service cost. This would enable you to make sure that the application developer is more of a partner in your business process than a one time vendor, who develops the app that you need for a lump sum price, and has no interest in supporting or helping you to increase the efficiency of your business through the app.

At AppDAS we believe our growth should be linked to the growth of our customers.  We believe in being partners to our clients, where we want to support through out their goals for their app. 

We have a strong team with abundance of experience in developing apps for some of the leading companies across continents.  We have a strong analytics and marketing team to support you in taking your business to the next level through digital mediums and mobility.",,M Tech,2006,2008,Information Technology,442,3
