",11,2020,"Listening, writing and curating stories of brands ","When I was a child, my Grandpa used to tell me stories about his youth. How he ran away from his house at a young age, made a living and was friends with movie stars. His stories made my day and I would share them with my friends. Soon, I became the stories guy. The key is attentive listening. 

I love to megaphone the stories of brands so they can align with the stories of people. I am a brand communication enthusiast with 3 years of work experience in Content and Social Media Marketing. Working with fast-paced agencies in client-facing roles gave me the skills to forge and strengthen stakeholder engagements. Listening and understanding the client’s project brief before sitting down with my team was the key part of my role. 

I have worked on social media marketing strategies, Employee communication and advertising projects for brands from different industries (technology, hospitality, FMCG and logistics). Using social media platforms to drive engagement toward a brand’s page has been my forte and passion. 

This passion lacked evidence-based knowledge and to fulfil that I pursued my master’s in marketing at The Australian National University. Here I studied courses like Strategic Management, Global Marketing and Brand Strategy. However, learning is beyond the walls of the classroom, so  I engaged in business competitions, event management and other professional development programs. This is when I learnt that there is truly so much more to learn. 

My love for stories continues with all the work I do. I cannot turn off the eye for a good story. I am always the one who asks, ‘What was going on in the mind of the team?’ when looking at a logo or an ad or even a picture. 

I want to be a part of that team weaving a brand's story. So, I am actively looking for any opportunities in the field of marketing and communication. This could be the next chapter of my story.

I, albeit possessing a proclivity for cynicism, am in agreement with the wordsmith and try to emulate this thought process in my actions.

I grew up in Abu Dhabi and was fascinated by the country’s rapid progress in terms of infrastructure, economic growth, and industrialization. The catalyst for this growth was the natural reserves of oil and the efficient extraction infrastructure put in place by the Government of UAE. I recognized the importance of an active and streamlined industrial sector and the pivotal role it plays in the progress of a society. Therefore, a major in chemical engineering was an ideal fit for me.

I had realized that exposure to real-time work environments is vital to being a successful professional and thus, has sought out numerous internships at companies functioning at various tiers in terms of scale. I interned for a month at Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd., Kochi, a government-owned industry, as an In-Plant Trainee. I was able to observe the day to day workings of a chemical plant during my time there. I also worked as an office intern for Rashid Al Mansoori Electromechanical L.L.C., Abu Dhabi to familiarize myself with the administrative challenges a technical organization faces and how to tackle them. I have widened my portfolio by working in non-technical areas. I was a writer and occasional editor for the online magazine Afflatus, a general article website that has recently transitioned into a technical and scientific platform for information and communication. I was part of the website’s core team for over a year and was involved with widening the website’s reach in addition to coordinating its day to day running. I also interned as a content writer for ARACIV Technologies Private Limited, a tech start-up founded at my University. My work commitments as a content writer involved the creation of engaging blog posts and generating content for their crowd-funding campaign. This involvement in a fledgling company showed me how a technical idea becomes a marketable product and how to bootstrap using minimal resources. I also freelance as a ghost blogger and content reviewer.

I have widened my interest overtime and my hobbies include writing poetry, amateur mobile photography, reading, and physical training. My poems are put up on my social media page ‘VIN’s Scribbles’.

While most of the students got motivational comments in that column, I was described as ""Passionately Curious"" by my teacher.
While most people ignore the smaller details, I tend to focus on them. Because I think the information lies in the small details. If a field interests me, I am inclined by my mind to know everything about that field. While some will say that I am good at research ""work"", I think it is more than that. I do not think that as ""work"", it is a necessity for my mind. I am passionate about such stuff.
I also tend to be extremely organised and tend to sometimes force this on others, which is, I think is a good ability for a healthy work environment.
I am greatly inspired by Technology and its past. I tend to focus on great leaders in Technology. My biggest inspiration is Steve Jobs. He was a man with a different thinking, inspired millions with his marketing skills and was a tech wiz of his time. I tend to follow his teachings as well as I can. He also pushed the idea of products being intuitive. He hated learning curves and always found ways to adapt the product to the user and not the other way around. This idea stayed in my mind when I first read his biography, and always comes back to me whenever I am writing or designing something.
I love writing. Whether it is an article or an email or even a shopping list. I format my words in a manner that is intuitive and relatable. I do not write in a manner that appeals to everyone, but I tend to write in a manner that everybody understands. 
Part of my motivation to pursue a career in Computer Science is the fact that it combines the future trends of technology with problem solving and aptitude, and I am passionate about both of those fields. I am good at problem solving and a part of that is reflected in my management skills.

- Created the foundation of the design system from scratch which includes colors, typography, layouts, iconography, grid and spacing, and complex components. This helped us to remove 77% of unused colors from the code.

Well, it changed mine.

When I was in college, I saw Transformers and got interested in making science fiction short films.
I taught myself filmmaking and software skills to create visual effects.

Luckily, our film won the best editing award at a film festival with 40+ entries.
That award wasn’t anything huge to celebrate but a small success gave birth to my passion.

I followed my passion and chose to be a creative professional.
Little did I know that watching movies will end up getting me in design, videos, and a creative career.

Today, I am working as a Product Designer in Berlin.
And, building @MillionFramesAcademy, where we are helping designers to be more successful by teaching them new skills.

👩🏻‍🎓  Taught more than 50+ students the art of animation and design,
🎯  Sold more than 5000 copies of design and video assets,
🎉  Have a community of over 14K supporters on social media platforms

Since childhood, creativity is something that has been very close to me and it has given me a lot in return. To give back to the community, I started my Instagram handle (@millionframes) to share design content for aspiring designers and creatives.

My mission is to impact as many creatives as I can and inspire them.

I'm learning every day and helping people on my way.

""Add a keyframe every day"" - This is something which I tell myself every new day to become better than yesterday.

Here's a bit about how I approach it.

Over the last year of my undergraduate career, I have worked towards developing a core skill set in modern full-stack web development. You can look at my work here: github.com/Itsaadarsh

• Workflow - VSCode, Git, Github, TypeScript, JavaScript. Terminal, Webpack, WSL

•  Backend - NodeJS, Express, Rest API, GraphQL, Websockets ,PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeORM, Mongoose, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, Unit testing 

• Frontend - HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, React, Gatsby, Apollo GraphQL, Next.js

My current work is spread across several projects including a Full-Stack ticketing booking application with microservices architecture, designing and working on a back-end architecture for a small start-up idea (OneStep), and participating in international level hackathons, etc.

Besides the activities mentioned above, I try to spend time playing games like Among Us, Candy Crush, Cyberpunk 2077 or watching web series and movies (currently watching The Office and Suits), also I listen to podcasts: Lex Fridman's ""AI Podcast"", JRE and Impaulsive are my daily binges. And last but not the least ""Music"" ya I listen to all sorts of music while I code let it be Hindi, English, Tamil, Spanish etc.

Those are some of my experiences, and I'd love to know more about yours. Shoot me an email at aadarsh-s@outlook.com, and let's chat! Whether it's about something you've read above or something just random, I promise the conversation will be an interesting one. I'm also actively seeking internship/ collaboration opportunities for Summer 2021, so if you have one in mind that you think I could add value to, please do reach out at the email above.

I'm Mohamed Zeeshan, a foreign affairs columnist and author of ‘Flying Blind: India’s Quest for Global Leadership’, published by Penguin Random House in January 2021.

I’m presently a staff writer for The Diplomat and Editor-in-Chief of Freedom Gazette, an acclaimed policy advocacy site based in India.

I’m a frequent writer on international affairs and my key areas of interest are Indian foreign policy, international political economy, economic development and global governance. I have previously worked with the global consulting firm Kearney, advised governments in the Middle East on issues of economic reform and state-building, and served with the Indian delegation to the United Nations in New York.

In 2017, I was publicly credited by His Excellency, the Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations, for my creative thinking in strategizing India’s successful and historic election to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). During that election, India became the first member state in UN history to replace a permanent member of the Security Council in the ICJ. India was elected over the United Kingdom, aided by a majority in the General Assembly.

As a writer, I have been published in over 10 leading international publications in both print and online media. I currently write a fortnightly column for The Diplomat on South Asian affairs. I also write 'The Z Factor' - a monthly Sunday column on national and global issues in the Deccan Herald, one of India's leading print dailies. Other media outlets featuring my opinion essays include The Straits Times, The Sydney Morning Herald, South China Morning Post, The National Interest, Haaretz, The Print, The Wire, ABP News, India Today and The Huffington Post. I have also been interviewed or featured by various international outlets, including The Hindu, The Times of India, HuffPost Live, BBC Radio, Voice of America, SBS Australia and others.

My writing is eclectic and covers the economic and political conditions of various parts of the world. My writing has been recognised and cited by academics and journalists around the world - and my work on reforming the Indian Foreign Service, in particular, has inspired discussion in the Parliament of India.

Reviewing and refining the research papers and chapters for non-native English authors.",7,2019,Freelance Science Editor at MogoEdit,"I am a science writer/editor with a multidisciplinary background in Bio-medical sciences. 

I graduated in Biotechnology and interned at the Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, US during my master’s in Bio-medical Genetics. The work at Mayo gave me chance to author an academic paper, results of which were highlighted in Nature Review. I subsequently worked in the pharmaceutical industry for about 3 years across a spectrum of research – from clinical studies to biosimilars. It was during this time that fell in love with writing in science. 

I think writing is an art, and more so when telling a story in science. Although both, ‘stories’ and ‘science’ have a common thread to spark fascination, one is commonly rooted in imagination, while the other in the empirical facts. It then becomes the job of the science writer to finely balance these and keep the reader in ever awe!

I have considerable experience and understanding of the end-to-end process of scientific communications- from conceptualisation, discussion, refining the study design to writing, reviewing, and publishing documents. I have been involved in writing research manuscripts, documents for regulatory submissions, newsletters for out-reach mediums, and synopsis for global conferences and symposiums.

Last year, I was very fortunate to receive King’s International Scholarship to pursue a second master’s in Immunology. Studying at King’s College, London gave me a chance to capture the excitement of cutting-edge science and horn writing skills, which further carved my inclination to pursue a career in science publishing industry. 

I travel extensively and have a great deal of interest in body-mind science and practices. I also write a blog called www.thecurledtales.com. Although it has just begun, I am loving the idea of connecting with people through written words. As I continue to work as a freelance science editor at Mogo Edits, it gives me immense satisfaction to help the work of non-native English authors reach global audience. 

I enjoy being active on Linkedin, as it inspires me to see the tremendous volume and spectrum of intriguing work that goes around. I am passionate to continue to work in this niche, while being a new mommy to my 4 months old infant. I look forward to networking with people sharing common interests and identify new career opportunities (preferably remote) in the life sciences and publishing industries. Let's connect!

Sound has been an integral part of my life, though I really started listening when I created my first music track. Life has all been much more fulfilling since then. Being a Mechanical Engineer by education, Math and Physics are among my favorite source of food for thought, and Sound is their audible amalgamation.

Storytelling is my area of expertise and the understanding of Rhythm, being an important aspect of it, helps me to contribute to projects from the script stage to the final output. Creating robust work pipelines and structure is my second nature, and this eventually helps in keeping everything organized, which again is one of my dearest obsession.

I have been an active contributor to world's best Education platform, BYJU'S, since 2015, working in collaboration with Disney, to create some amazing movie like videos and games that make students (and parents) fall in love with learning.

As the Creative Director of Sound, I play the role of making sure that anything and everything Audio, right from the Sound Design and Music to Voice (and thus the content) is in its best form for anyone who is listening.

I am proficient in Pro Tools, Cubase/Nuendo, Logic Pro, iZotope RX and use audio plugins from Soundly, u-he, Waves, Native Instruments, SoundToys etc. to get the sound I am looking for. I believe in using the right tool required for the job, so knowing them all in-depth is crucial; and it also helps me in troubleshooting for my peers. Live sound recording with some amazing hardware from Sound Devices, DPA, Ambient, Lectrosonics, TASCAM, Zoom, Rode etc. are in my list of experiences and getting the shot right by communicating well with the director and all relevant stakeholders is something I prefer to do as part of the goal of making things as close to perfect as possible.

At times when I am unable to find the right tools to help me with all this, I prefer building them on my own. The hobbyist coder in me loves to create new audio plugins and web based apps, and the writer side gets the stories written. This has also helped me in a better ideation strategy for the products I work on.

Btw, if you're still reading, do let me know what's your favorite sound in the world. And if you want, let's talk about it. I'm listening.",Vellore Institute of Technology,Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.),2011,2015,Mechanical Engineering,485,2

Becoming an Electronics and Computer Engineer ensures me of becoming a pundit of a product as this would impart in me the knowledge of both the hardware and software aspects.

Making the three worlds of academics, sports, and extracurricular link up to develop practical skills is my goal. Participated frequently in basketball, swimming, and cricket at state level. These sports have improved my social effectiveness inculcating adaptability, sense of responsibility, liveliness, and never giving in. Also participation in regional debating and public speaking competitions has made me an extrovert with good oratory skills.

Connecting with people from different walks of life and developing camaraderie gratifies me. Having lived in 8 states across the length of India I have mates from different parts of the nation which has given me understanding about distinct cultures and people. Hence, whenever I meet a new person something common pops up between us in a wink which establishes our relationship.

Adventure drives my survival. Overcoming fears and taking that one leap of faith to enter a new world is what excites me the most. Once I got 14 stitches and lost 5 teeth as a kid doing some activity in the night, thankfully they were temporary teeth.

On a lighter note, I also consider myself as a freelance 'Taste & Texture Maestro' to all the nourishment and sustenance laboratories (food outlets) in and around me.

| About Camelport 

Logistics is one of the most fragmented and disorganized sectors in our country's economy, subjected to low price discovery, malpractices and under utilization of resources due to an inefficient market.

At Camelport, we are attempting to revolutionize the billion dollar surface cargo industry in India, which is the backbone of supply chain, by automating freight sales. 

Using our solution, shippers get the best rates in the market in real time; whereas truckers win more business and are able to fluently organize their supply.

Previously I was a postdoc in Dr. Peter Nelson’s lab in FHCRC. My research interest focused on DNA damage repair in prostate cancer particularly HR deficiency and PARP inhibitor context. I was also interested in role of prostate tumor microenvironment in therapy resistance and how you can manipulate and overcome the resistance. All of my previous publications involved DNA damage response pathway effect especially non homologous end-joining following PARP inhibition and different radiation treatment like brachytherapy, gamma radiation in prostate cancer. In recent study I am focusing on effectiveness of supraphysiological androgen as a treatment opportunity in AR dependent prostate cancer, specifically in DNA damage repair deficient subgroups. 
 Before that I have successfully defended my Thesis, entitled “DNA Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer Cells in Response to Radiation”. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is prevalent in ~60% of prostate cancer patients. Using PARP inhibitor rucaparib (Clovis, originally by Pfizer) along with radiation exhibited synergic lethality in prostate cancer cells.

I always had a keen interest in electrical and electronic machinery and the physics behind them. For me, physics is my world and thus I love everything related to it.

Apart from Electrical and Electronics, I am also interested in quantum and astrophysics. I am heavily indulged in scientific content creation and writing scientific blogs since 2013 when I was 11 years old.

I have also written a book on astronomy, astrophysics and space exploration named as 'THROUGH THE WORMHOLE' which is published in Amazon Kindle. In this book, I tried to explain topics like black holes, dark energy, dark matter, cosmic microwave background, stars, the machinery of Shuttle and Soyuz, exoplanets and much more...

From June 2019, I started writing about Astronomy, astrophysics and Quantum physics on my new website: The Dynamic Frequency (www.thedynamicfrequency.blogspot.com). This is my 4th website and I started it because I closed the previous ones.

I am also interested in the Full Stack Development field and have a profound knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MERN stack development. I am a specialist in ReactJs library. In the backend, I have a good knowledge of PHP, SQL, MySQL, NodeJs and MongoDB. Apart from these, I know Python, C, C++ and MATLAB.

Then I decided to embark on a Master of Technology in Mechatronics  course to eventually be an academician.
My specialties include:
*ROS (Robot Operating System): Developing programs using ROS and C++ language. • Operating, managing, and uploading data into GitHub. • The working and functionality of Ubuntu 12.04 version (Linux)operating system. 
*Workspace LT for ABB 2400, Adam’s environment for linkages. • Working knowledge of LabView and NI Vision Assistant. • MATLAB and SPICE simulation techniques. • Basic knowledge in C and C++languages that were used while coding for ROS. 
*A Certified Scrum Master certification dated 8th September,2019 by the Scrum Alliance organization.  *Qualified UGC NET (National Eligibility Test) held in November 2017 with 63.14 as the overall percentile in Electronics Sciences Test.

A year ago, I couldn't have imagined that my Linkedin would be about Content Creation and Video Editing. But here we are.
The most valuable possession that someone could give me is their time. And for you being here and reading this, I am already grateful. 
So this story begins with me not getting selected for the Hindi Literary Association at my college, which compelled me into writing a poem on failure. I ended up making a short video of me reciting that poem which I later uploaded on youtube. And there it was. My first opportunity at creating something which helped me cope and find purpose.
Throughout the locked down period, I created more videos that expressed me and the things I stand for. I learned Video Editing, Sound Design, Cinematography, and many other aspects of Film Making. This process not only proved to be cathartic for me but also helped me channelize my creative energy into something meaningful.
The most captivating thing about Video Creation and Film Making for me is that I can tell any story that I want to tell and I get to chose how I tell it. I can truly be myself in this process. The possibilities, as well as the creative opportunities, are literally endless here. And that is something I thrive on.

My role as an Independent Video Content Creator is to help you spread your message to your clients/ potential clients. Here are the services I offer -

• Creating and Editing Highly Engaging and Effective Videos for your brand to spread your message

• Storyboarding for Stragecially Enhanced Marketing 

If you have made it this far, I am definately looking forward to chatting with you. Please hit me up here on Linkedin or drop in a mail at siddanube@gmail.com

She has worked in several industries, of course! IT segment.  One of her favourite pastime hobby was to discuss World History and Indian Independence with her father.  Her current hobbies include art and craft, cooking different styles of cuisine with her family and her lorry full of friends left with no option but to be her ‘guinea pigs’.  An ardent fan of carnatic music, she was the ‘twelfth man’ accompanist along with her brother to their mother the ‘man of the match’ whose pitch was A - 6 ‘kattai’, this would leave her breathless in several household functions.  So she dutifully quit signing to let her mother be in peace and started playing the violin instead. She still has the audacity to torment her violin tutor who puts up with her during the weekends week after week.   

Dreaming and imagining stories caught her during her college days when she had the luxury of free time to read several fictions.  They had to be sleeping partners (commercial term) in crime while she was perusing her professional degrees specially Chartered Accountancy when she had to ‘move a mountain to catch a rat’.  She was quenching her thirst by participating and scripting the skits for her office cultural events.  However partners in crime wouldn't leave her alone and became ‘law of dominance’ in the year 2010. Her head with the brain of a fruit fly was about to explode, she then garnered the courage to discuss this with her friend who encouraged her to pen it down.   Y?me was born thus.

She lives with her Architect husband and two school going brats called daughters in Chennai where she is currently employed.
