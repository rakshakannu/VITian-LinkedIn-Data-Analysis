I went Kota for IIT preparation and had a strong feeling about becoming an engineer any time soon. However, couldn't make it through and at that time I was in situation like crossing the rubicon so I decided to go further as I was getting a seat in VIT so decided to go with VIT Vellore. I pursued mechanical engineering. I was satisfied with the awards given to me every year for my outstanding academic performance but the most amazing feeling I have had when our team started thinking to manufacture the motorsport bike from scratch. I worked as Head of Department of powertrain and transmission in our team called ‚ÄúREV Mechanics‚Äù. After lots of thinking, designing, analyzing, and finally procuring materials and manufacturing we completed the bike and competed in Spain in the event called Motostudent  2018. Throughout these years, we as a team invested our time and money to just manufacture the bike and use something we learned in engineering. Due to my love towards social work, I participated in social drive organized by Lions club VIT and was awarded for regular donor by VIT youth cross society during my Bachelors. Along with these works, I started working in research papers and published 2 papers which was based on innovation, designing and analysing the design. To get better knowledge of work in companies I completed internship in 5 companies namely Toyota Motors, Aether Biomedical, Ford Motors, Hero Motocorp and finally Go Zero Mobility during my engineering. From these internships, I have in-depth knowledge in Automobile engineering, Total Quality Management, Reverse Engineering, 3D Printing and designing of Packaging. The last internship and one of my research paper motivated me towards the Electric Vehicle and now I am doing masters in Automobile Engineering specialization in Electric and hybrid Vehicle that is the combined course of Vel Tech University and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI, Pune). I have also passed CSWA exam and I am a certified Solidworks associate. I have also worked as a campus ambassador and managed the Tamil Nadu  team in Associates of Muslim Profession (AMP) where I was awarded certificate for my great work.

My relatively short career has had me acquire valuable experience working on high-impact projects in fast-pace environments - collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders across product, engineering and business to design and ship solutions - in verticals across e-commerce, fintech, hyperlocal and education.

Over the past two years at Flipkart, I have had an opportunity to work on a breadth of projects - ranging from Flipkart Games and Survey platform to Flipkart Ideas and revamping the Wishlist - which have fuelled my growth as a product designer. My current interests lie in leveraging the power of Gamification to create meaningful long-term relationships with our users.

**
I like to think of design as problem solving within constraints - which fuels its fascination for me. No matter the domain, I believe the power of design lies in its potential to contribute to solving the most pressing of problems prevalent in the world today in fun and engaging ways.

Dealing with the ambiguity of problems I am faced with on a day-to-day basis, my go-to philosophy is - ""Optimise for human motivation and you'll never go astray"" - which entails designing solutions for users in their respective contexts - an acknowledgement of a seemingly simple fact that our end-users are humans, fundamentally flawed in their own beautiful ways and dealing with complexities (other than problem you're trying to solve) in their day-to-day lives.

Since childhood, creativity is something that has been very close to me and it has given me a lot in return. To give back to the community, I started my Instagram handle (@millionframes) to share design content for aspiring designers and creatives.

My mission is to impact as many creatives as I can and inspire them.

And if not the world, design lifts me up personally and sometimes that's enough.

Ever since I was a little kid, I had an eye for design/art. It started in my school days, with imitating my brother's artworks, to whom I owe my love for design. I went on to create scribbles in my school notebooks, portraits of school crushes, movie characters, comic characters, bikes, aliens and what not. I may not have been extra-ordinarily great at it, but I had an edge over other people and that's what kept me going. I tried to give more shape to my design skills during my college days; explored design in the digital space and started making money out of what I could do-be it designing logos/advertisements for acquaintances or trying my hands in entrepreneurship.

Although I was set to become an engineer, and the degree did fetch me a job as a Software Developer, I did not give up on the possibility of having a fully-fledged career in design. To do so, I chose the field of User Experience and Interface design as it called to all my passions; creativity, problem-solving in the tech-space and the scope of making things beautiful and powerful. It has been a great ride ever since.

When am not working on any professional creatives, you may find me lost in music, cinema, or books; some other interests that hugely inspire me and my work. I tend to educate and refine myself to be a better individual with every passing day.

There is certainly a lot to learn for me, and a long way to go, but I believe I am learning and getting there one day a time, and it is my thirst for design and the zeal to share it with the world, that still keeps me up at night.

#Studentforlife","Hi, hello, namaste. Let me give a short intro about me. My self prem Kumar M. A UI/UX Designer by profession and photographer by passion. I have completed my bachelor's degree in the field of Multimedia and Animation at VIT University.

I have 1 plus year of industrial working experience in UI/UX design. I specialize in crafting usable POS, Web, Mobile app UI, and product design. To be more precise, I have my secret sauce to covert bounce users into the conversion by using a heat map and related researches. I use a creative approach to solve problems. 

Why I have chosen this field? and my portfolio will answer this question. Yes, you guess it right. I love to create problems (you read it correctly) then I solve them. Just kidding. Other than design I love to travel, trying out black magic, playing guitar, and photography.

Before ending, If you have an idea to learn photography and its related stuff, visit my blog www.framefable.com"". To view my works visit www.prem-kumar.in my portfolio website.

They need sturdy bicep strength and lots of lung power. But one by one, the manly tabla, ghatam, mridangam, shehnai, and the unwieldy rudra veena have all been mastered by women. There was one instrument that stayed stubbornly hyper-macho ‚Äî the saxophone. The only time you saw a woman with a sax in India was in ads and movies. Till the sax sisters from Mangalore, MS Lavanya, 29, and Subbalaxmi, 31, arrived on the scene to play just about every genre ‚Äî from jazz to Carnatic, and fusion to Bollywood. 

At the recent Chennai music season, Lavanya and her alto sax drew curious crowds. She is young, petite, dressed unusually glamorously for the Carnatic stage and totally unselfconscious about the effect she is creating. She sits cross-legged on the stage, a totally un-sax position, and starts playing like one would the nagaswaram or the shehnai. Her music is vigorous, fast and it doesn't take the audience long to burst into applause every once in a while. She tells you later that she would prefer a leisurely exploration of music, not this frenzied brilliance. ""But I am told that this is what everyone wants,"" she says in cheerful exasperation. 

The saxophone has already made inroads into Carnatic music thanks to the pioneering work of their guru Kadri Gopalnath, but it still isn't easy coaxing the instrument to cough up gamakas (glides). ""It is tough but once I start playing, I am only bothered about perfection. You need a lot of strength and energy to play the sax ‚Äî juggling fingering, blowing, balancing ‚Äî there is no time to worry about what anyone says or thinks,"" says Lavanya, who is playing alone this time as sister Subbalaxmi is stuck with an assignment in Mumbai.",2,1998,Celebrity Female Saxophonist,,Chennai,,2003,2005,,19,3
