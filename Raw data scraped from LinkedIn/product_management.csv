I am a graduate student at Columbia University NY, an engineer, and an aspiring product/program manager.

Previously, I worked at Capillary Technologies as a Product Manager Intern to solve the toughest problems in eCommerce and CRM. Prior to my experience at Capillary, I interned in multiple analytics roles across domains such as marketing, technology, and finance. This includes my business analytics internship at Leo Burnett India, Software Developer / Analytics Internship at Nokia, and Sterling Software. 

I’ve always been captivated about using technology to scale up products. I founded a student organization in my sophomore year through which I established a platform for engineering students to build tech products. The organization grew exponentially within a year and received the best student chapter award by IEEE. I was also awarded the prestigious Richard E. Merwin Award for my contributions to the student community.

I enjoy taking up responsibilities and ownership of tasks. I’ve been a member and coordinator of various societies throughout my undergrad, and each one of those experiences has helped me shape who I am.

I would love to get in touch with you - we can talk about anything pertaining to products, technology, business, or startups!

- The concept of consumer logic and how rational yet irrational it can be. 
- The challenge of communicating in a way that persuades and convinces consumers always requires optimization—so you're optimizing for something that is both rational and irrational.

In this world of demand and customers: I create, scale, and optimize business portfolios. I do this by generating revenue through digital products and services. To accomplish this, I focus on audience and business needs, understanding product mechanics, tracking metrics and dissecting performance, and championing product improvements.

I have built and grown digital products for Nationwide Insurance, AXA Asia, Government of Andhra Pradesh, Shipping ministry of India, Paulig Coffee, and Lassila & Tikanoja. One of my memorable projects was building the port community digital platform for Indian Maritime trade. Partly because of that product, India improved its ease of doing business from 100 to 77 in 2018. Seeing digital products easing bottlenecks and helping people is what I work for!

My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself:

I have high Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
- I bring people together. Leadership, employees, vendors, customers.
- I value my team and make sure that the team keeps skilling as needed

I can create scale and optimize digital products:
- Key Account Management: I put the customer at the center of all that I do.
- I bridge digital product management and creative strategies
- Plan features in smaller sprints keeping in mind macro changes in markets
- Manage high-quality product roadmaps based on vision and strategy

I enable product sales and user acquisition:
- I monitor success and usage criteria and developing new user stories to drive product improvement
- Create campaigns and programs to increase digital adoption by customers

When I am not working, I am either out cycling somewhere, running a marathon, or learning to play the blues! I also collaborate with All hands and Hearts, a US-based volunteer organization.

I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives.

• Undergraduate student swotting up Data Analysis and AI frameworks extensively.
• I aspire to help small businesses/start-ups or even MNC's to make sense of the data they produce and derive AI based suggestions to improve it to the best of my abilities.
• However, my deep interests lie with core AI for example, reinforcement learning and deep-learning.
• I've worked with a few companies as an intern and improved my skills to develop and deploy data driven & ML models. 
• Intermediate experience with developing android/iOS applications with Flutter and web based applications with react.

I will be honest, while I don't claim to be the best I am adept with my skill set and would love an opportunity to showcase them as I work along.

Product Manager since 2019 in SAP SuccessFactors People Analytics area. The major challenge was to ensure the timely launch of the product by first getting the left-out work completed. It was challenging, as while I was learning the What & Why of the product, the need of the hour was to focus more on the When part. The initial juggling was not so smooth but was able to manage to take the product into BETA release. I got an opportunity to manage the BETA program which proved to be tremendously beneficial in getting real-time customer feedback. For some of the feedback, we went back to the white-board & made adjustments before we launched our product to a wider customer base. We were finally able to roll-out the product in early 2020 to wider audience. 

Currently, focusing mainly on customer adoption & growth of the product along with further product features development.

Though we are complex, mysterious beings who are often difficult to each other, I feel storytelling reminds us we’re all the same.

My story is one of a data explorer. 

Back in university, I conducted open surveys with help of my batch mates and performed statistical analysis on the responses as I was curious to know if there was any link between the choice of course taken on campus and factors such as the day on which classes were scheduled, the distance of the student's hostel from relevant classroom,  branch of the student, the sex ratio of that specific branch, etc.

During my professional spell at Accenture, I wanted to know we could optimize productivity as a team by tracking and understanding our working patterns. I was glad that using my data analysis skills in excel and R, I was able to assist automation team in building interactive dashboards that helped us do the same. This ultimately translated to a 30% increase in team productivity.

While working as a Data Analyst at Flipkart,
I solved complex supply chain optimization problems using statistical analysis , understood the nitty gritty of e-commerce business and worked on improving key performance indicators such as delivery speed, customer satisfaction index, transport vehicle utilisation and many more.

Right now, I'm building my  portfolio of skills as I strongly intend to grow as a data scientist who can contribute and add value to organizations with a mission statement.
