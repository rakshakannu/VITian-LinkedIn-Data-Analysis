I went Kota for IIT preparation and had a strong feeling about becoming an engineer any time soon. However, couldn't make it through and at that time I was in situation like crossing the rubicon so I decided to go further as I was getting a seat in VIT so decided to go with VIT Vellore. I pursued mechanical engineering. I was satisfied with the awards given to me every year for my outstanding academic performance but the most amazing feeling I have had when our team started thinking to manufacture the motorsport bike from scratch. I worked as Head of Department of powertrain and transmission in our team called ‚ÄúREV Mechanics‚Äù. After lots of thinking, designing, analyzing, and finally procuring materials and manufacturing we completed the bike and competed in Spain in the event called Motostudent  2018. Throughout these years, we as a team invested our time and money to just manufacture the bike and use something we learned in engineering. Due to my love towards social work, I participated in social drive organized by Lions club VIT and was awarded for regular donor by VIT youth cross society during my Bachelors. Along with these works, I started working in research papers and published 2 papers which was based on innovation, designing and analysing the design. To get better knowledge of work in companies I completed internship in 5 companies namely Toyota Motors, Aether Biomedical, Ford Motors, Hero Motocorp and finally Go Zero Mobility during my engineering. From these internships, I have in-depth knowledge in Automobile engineering, Total Quality Management, Reverse Engineering, 3D Printing and designing of Packaging. The last internship and one of my research paper motivated me towards the Electric Vehicle and now I am doing masters in Automobile Engineering specialization in Electric and hybrid Vehicle that is the combined course of Vel Tech University and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI, Pune). I have also passed CSWA exam and I am a certified Solidworks associate. I have also worked as a campus ambassador and managed the Tamil Nadu  team in Associates of Muslim Profession (AMP) where I was awarded certificate for my great work.

My relatively short career has had me acquire valuable experience working on high-impact projects in fast-pace environments - collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders across product, engineering and business to design and ship solutions - in verticals across e-commerce, fintech, hyperlocal and education.

Over the past two years at Flipkart, I have had an opportunity to work on a breadth of projects - ranging from Flipkart Games and Survey platform to Flipkart Ideas and revamping the Wishlist - which have fuelled my growth as a product designer. My current interests lie in leveraging the power of Gamification to create meaningful long-term relationships with our users.

**
I like to think of design as problem solving within constraints - which fuels its fascination for me. No matter the domain, I believe the power of design lies in its potential to contribute to solving the most pressing of problems prevalent in the world today in fun and engaging ways.

Dealing with the ambiguity of problems I am faced with on a day-to-day basis, my go-to philosophy is - ""Optimise for human motivation and you'll never go astray"" - which entails designing solutions for users in their respective contexts - an acknowledgement of a seemingly simple fact that our end-users are humans, fundamentally flawed in their own beautiful ways and dealing with complexities (other than problem you're trying to solve) in their day-to-day lives.

I am interested in product design and development, experienced in design studies from sketching, prototyping, feasibility studies like FMEA to manufacturing the product. 

I graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with my Master‚Äôs in Mechanical Engineering. This degree helped me in developing unique skills to be a detailed oriented engineer while addressing the customer-specific requirements. I took project-driven courses to get hands-on experience which required critical thinking and problem-solving skills. During my free time, I have expanded my knowledge in continuous improvement techniques by completing the Lean Six Sigma Green belt and mechanical design skills by securing certification in SolidWorks.

I most recently worked as a Manufacturing Engineer at Additive Manufacturing lab where I had learned industry-specific skills. I had worked on diverse projects and fabricated products by using transferable skills in the field of Additive Manufacturing (Metal 3D Printer) which includes process development, design of experiments, SolidWorks, GD&T, and structural analysis.

While working at TATA Motors, I had altered the 3D CAD models for sequential trolleys used in the assembly plants, which led to a decrease in production time by 10 minutes. Also, I acted as a key interface between plant supervisors, operators, and welders from Day 1. For that, I needed excellent communication and problem-solving skills combined with my theoretical knowledge and adaptability to excel in a new industry.

Well, it changed mine.

When I was in college, I saw Transformers and got interested in making science fiction short films.
I taught myself filmmaking and software skills to create visual effects.

Luckily, our film won the best editing award at a film festival with 40+ entries.
That award wasn‚Äôt anything huge to celebrate but a small success gave birth to my passion.

I followed my passion and chose to be a creative professional.
Little did I know that watching movies will end up getting me in design, videos, and a creative career.

Today, I am working as a Product Designer in Berlin.
And, building @MillionFramesAcademy, where we are helping designers to be more successful by teaching them new skills.

üî•  7 years of experience as a designer,
üöÄ  Created 30+ digital Products for creatives and filmmakers,
üë©üèª‚Äçüéì  Taught more than 50+ students the art of animation and design,
üéØ  Sold more than 5000 copies of design and video assets,
üéâ  Have a community of over 14K supporters on social media platforms

Since childhood, creativity is something that has been very close to me and it has given me a lot in return. To give back to the community, I started my Instagram handle (@millionframes) to share design content for aspiring designers and creatives.

My mission is to impact as many creatives as I can and inspire them.

I'm learning every day and helping people on my way.

""Add a keyframe every day"" - This is something which I tell myself every new day to become better than yesterday.

207,Entertainment,United Arab Emirates,False,2018.0,I help companies improve their Visual Identities by providing them with great media content.,"Commercial Photographers are a dime a dozen and it can be frustrating to find someone who has the commitment to quality & work that you are looking for. I understand your predicament. That's where I come in. To give you the quality of work that you are expecting without having to stress too much about it.

Having worked with the likes of Sanipex Group, Thunder Road Barracuda, Pit-Fire Pizza, Steigenberger Hotel, Kingfisher Lodge, Al Badayer Oasis & Private Clients, I am confident of being able to deliver amazing looking images that will help spruce up your social profiles.

WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER

‚ó¶ There is a lot that goes into getting great images and I am there to help at every step of the way. Plan first and then execute.

‚ó¶ I make sure I don't overbook or overlap with other projects so that you have my undivided attention - 100%.

‚ó¶ Falling back upon my years of experience i will let you know what works and what doesn't.

‚ó¶ And at the end of the day you receive files faster and at the best quality possible. 

What I want is for you, ""THE CLIENT"" to have an amazing experience with me, whether you are a small start-up or an established house, it doesn't matter. I am looking to form long term relationships so that you don't have to go around searching again for the best option. I am just a call or an email away.

But here's the bonus. When you hire me, you not only get a photographer but someone who is experienced in Graphic Design & Branding. 14 years of experience to be exact. AN ALL-IN-ONE PACKAGE in short.

So, get in touch if you are:-

- A Company looking to update their E-Commerce listing with professional looking product images.

- Hospitality professionals who need to update their social media profiles with great looking images to draw in more customers.

- Property owners who need beautiful photos to give your property the attention it requires on various listing sites.

And if not the world, design lifts me up personally and sometimes that's enough.

Ever since I was a little kid, I had an eye for design/art. It started in my school days, with imitating my brother's artworks, to whom I owe my love for design. I went on to create scribbles in my school notebooks, portraits of school crushes, movie characters, comic characters, bikes, aliens and what not. I may not have been extra-ordinarily great at it, but I had an edge over other people and that's what kept me going. I tried to give more shape to my design skills during my college days; explored design in the digital space and started making money out of what I could do-be it designing logos/advertisements for acquaintances or trying my hands in entrepreneurship.

Although I was set to become an engineer, and the degree did fetch me a job as a Software Developer, I did not give up on the possibility of having a fully-fledged career in design. To do so, I chose the field of User Experience and Interface design as it called to all my passions; creativity, problem-solving in the tech-space and the scope of making things beautiful and powerful. It has been a great ride ever since.

When am not working on any professional creatives, you may find me lost in music, cinema, or books; some other interests that hugely inspire me and my work. I tend to educate and refine myself to be a better individual with every passing day.

There is certainly a lot to learn for me, and a long way to go, but I believe I am learning and getting there one day a time, and it is my thirst for design and the zeal to share it with the world, that still keeps me up at night.

#Studentforlife","Hi, hello, namaste. Let me give a short intro about me. My self prem Kumar M. A UI/UX Designer by profession and photographer by passion. I have completed my bachelor's degree in the field of Multimedia and Animation at VIT University.

I have 1 plus year of industrial working experience in UI/UX design. I specialize in crafting usable POS, Web, Mobile app UI, and product design. To be more precise, I have my secret sauce to covert bounce users into the conversion by using a heat map and related researches. I use a creative approach to solve problems. 

Why I have chosen this field? and my portfolio will answer this question. Yes, you guess it right. I love to create problems (you read it correctly) then I solve them. Just kidding. Other than design I love to travel, trying out black magic, playing guitar, and photography.

Before ending, If you have an idea to learn photography and its related stuff, visit my blog www.framefable.com"". To view my works visit www.prem-kumar.in my portfolio website.

My interest in Marketing and Advertising has been there for quite some time, and it is a field I am very intrigued with, for it is a culmination of both academic knowledge and creativity, something which is as unique as me, and just absolutely fitting.
What I seek are opportunities where I can get to apply these traits and which in turn can help me grow as a professional.

Co.W.L.L,"Through the years I have been told or perhaps  taught that sky is the limit as its been etched on a mediocre mind. But  one's ability  is just limitless as I always believed and then there  foot prints on the moon. Would any day try out opportunity  that excites me,  take new challenges, meet new people, ask questions - I am curious, target driven, tenacious & focused. Graduated from VIT University with Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, got placed in reputed IT firms which I knew wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea (Coffee helps me when my brain needs a hug). I took up Sales which was highly challenging and did seem like what I really wanted to do. This job would definitely be part of my lesson on entrepreneurship as well.
   
24/7 is the time I work best and  am a trained all-nighter believing dreams should be something which doesn‚Äôt make you sleep. Tennis & running keeps me pumped up all day  which makes my hobby. Never give up attitude has taken me so far.  Still seeking to learn more everyday and exploring more opportunities where I could use the knowledge I have rendered in few courses I have done. I don‚Äôt mind getting my hands dirty as long as learning is part of it . I have organized events, performed, anchored, auditioned and more. 

As for sales I am driven by tips and support from many mentors who are professionals in this field. I wouldn‚Äôt regard selling a product an achievement rather a customer‚Äôs smile when I have  their appointment or a smile from a cold call. The product selling will come along.

Core focuses of interest include: Sales Management , Business Development, Marketing Strategy , Marketing Management , Sales Process, Consultancy.

Throughout my career, I have been driven by my intellectual curiosity to find answers to the most pressing questions. As a child, I recall annoying my physicist dad asking him a ""why so?"" every time he came up with ""Everything happens for a reason and the reason is Physics"" perception. This curiosity made me take up a bachelor's degree in general physics and later a master's degree in physics.

With 1+ years of experience as a business intelligence analyst at two different companies, one completely on sales and the other on healthcare revenue management, I could understand the broader aspects of data driven business.

My intellectual curiosity also drives me to be lifelong learner. I am currently pursuing my second master's degree in Data analytics from National College of Ireland, Dublin. The projects that kept me busy and amused are enlisted in the projects section.

I enjoy travelling and eating my way around the world, reading national politics and talking about the future of mobile and automobile technologies. So If you ever want to bounce ideas off me, feel free to contact me: rite2barath@gmail.com.

1475,Marketing and Advertising,"Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia",False,2020.0,"Listening, writing and curating stories of brands ","When I was a child, my Grandpa used to tell me stories about his youth. How he ran away from his house at a young age, made a living and was friends with movie stars. His stories made my day and I would share them with my friends. Soon, I became the stories guy. The key is attentive listening. 

I love to megaphone the stories of brands so they can align with the stories of people. I am a brand communication enthusiast with 3 years of work experience in Content and Social Media Marketing. Working with fast-paced agencies in client-facing roles gave me the skills to forge and strengthen stakeholder engagements. Listening and understanding the client‚Äôs project brief before sitting down with my team was the key part of my role. 

I have worked on social media marketing strategies, Employee communication and advertising projects for brands from different industries (technology, hospitality, FMCG and logistics). Using social media platforms to drive engagement toward a brand‚Äôs page has been my forte and passion. 

This passion lacked evidence-based knowledge and to fulfil that I pursued my master‚Äôs in marketing at The Australian National University. Here I studied courses like Strategic Management, Global Marketing and Brand Strategy. However, learning is beyond the walls of the classroom, so  I engaged in business competitions, event management and other professional development programs. This is when I learnt that there is truly so much more to learn. 

My love for stories continues with all the work I do. I cannot turn off the eye for a good story. I am always the one who asks, ‚ÄòWhat was going on in the mind of the team?‚Äô when looking at a logo or an ad or even a picture. 

I want to be a part of that team weaving a brand's story. So, I am actively looking for any opportunities in the field of marketing and communication. This could be the next chapter of my story.

I apply the same logic in product marketing and consumer satisfaction. In order to bring ideas collectively, influencing an end result or whether to optimize and scale for future growth, I try to connect with consumer's irrational logic.

I had built and led the Operations team as well as other departments of Doorzy, a hyperlocal on-demand delivery startup, introducing various functionalities and operational solutions aiming to meet consumer requirements.

Our product is called MARS that uses deep learning to send personalized offers to each customer of a platform. The tool works within our client's business constraints and campaign budgets, and best of all it constantly learns from their user's habbits.

I have helped our clients achieve upto 13% increase in retention rate as well as give life to their dormant customers. 

We want to automate the process of promotional marketing, so that there is no need to manually do offer construction based on user segments anymore. MARS also examines upto 150+ features to decide what is the right offer for the right customer.

Currently, we're looking for Early Adopters who will also get access to free campaigns. If you're interested in learning more visit our website or get in touch with me.

I summarize results and curate reports generated by SEngine apps for oncologists, clinical trials, internal research projects, and outside collaborators. I regularly review scientific and medical literature concerning newly developed oncology drugs to be employed in PARIS¬Æ tests.  My long-standing knowledge of cancer signaling pathways and understanding of genomics has placed me on a unique position to integrate results with in-depth cancer genomics, cancer biology, large data-set analysis and individual patient clinical data.
Previously I was a postdoc in Dr. Peter Nelson‚Äôs lab in FHCRC. My research interest focused on DNA damage repair in prostate cancer particularly HR deficiency and PARP inhibitor context. I was also interested in role of prostate tumor microenvironment in therapy resistance and how you can manipulate and overcome the resistance. All of my previous publications involved DNA damage response pathway effect especially non homologous end-joining following PARP inhibition and different radiation treatment like brachytherapy, gamma radiation in prostate cancer. In recent study I am focusing on effectiveness of supraphysiological androgen as a treatment opportunity in AR dependent prostate cancer, specifically in DNA damage repair deficient subgroups. 
 Before that I have successfully defended my Thesis, entitled ‚ÄúDNA Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer Cells in Response to Radiation‚Äù. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is prevalent in ~60% of prostate cancer patients. Using PARP inhibitor rucaparib (Clovis, originally by Pfizer) along with radiation exhibited synergic lethality in prostate cancer cells.

Working with fast-paced agencies in client-facing roles gave me the skills to forge and strengthen stakeholder engagements. Listening and understanding the client‚Äôs project brief before sitting down with my team was the key part of my role. 

I have worked on social media marketing strategies, Employee communication and advertising projects for brands from different industries (technology, hospitality, FMCG and logistics). Using social media platforms to drive engagement toward a brand‚Äôs page has been my forte and passion. 

This passion lacked evidence-based knowledge and to fulfil that I pursued my master‚Äôs in marketing at The Australian National University. Here I studied courses like Strategic Management, Global Marketing and Brand Strategy. However, learning is beyond the walls of the classroom, so  I engaged in business competitions, event management and other professional development programs. This is when I learnt that there is truly so much more to learn. 

My love for stories continues with all the work I do. I cannot turn off the eye for a good story. I am always the one who asks, ‚ÄòWhat was going on in the mind of the team?‚Äô when looking at a logo or an ad or even a picture. 

I want to be a part of that team weaving a brand's story. So, I am actively looking for any opportunities in the field of marketing and communication. This could be the next chapter of my story.

2088,Consumer Goods,"Kerala, India",False,2020.0,Chemical Engineer | Content Writer | Ghost blogger | Poet,"The genius of Shakespeare once penned ""There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so"". I, albeit possessing a proclivity for cynicism, am in agreement with the wordsmith and try to emulate this thought process in my actions.

I grew up in Abu Dhabi and was fascinated by the country‚Äôs rapid progress in terms of infrastructure, economic growth, and industrialization. The catalyst for this growth was the natural reserves of oil and the efficient extraction infrastructure put in place by the Government of UAE. I recognized the importance of an active and streamlined industrial sector and the pivotal role it plays in the progress of a society. Therefore, a major in chemical engineering was an ideal fit for me.

I had realized that exposure to real-time work environments is vital to being a successful professional and thus, has sought out numerous internships at companies functioning at various tiers in terms of scale. I interned for a month at Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd., Kochi, a government-owned industry, as an In-Plant Trainee. I was able to observe the day to day workings of a chemical plant during my time there. I also worked as an office intern for Rashid Al Mansoori Electromechanical L.L.C., Abu Dhabi to familiarize myself with the administrative challenges a technical organization faces and how to tackle them. I have widened my portfolio by working in non-technical areas. I was a writer and occasional editor for the online magazine Afflatus, a general article website that has recently transitioned into a technical and scientific platform for information and communication. I was part of the website‚Äôs core team for over a year and was involved with widening the website‚Äôs reach in addition to coordinating its day to day running. I also interned as a content writer for ARACIV Technologies Private Limited, a tech start-up founded at my University. My work commitments as a content writer involved the creation of engaging blog posts and generating content for their crowd-funding campaign. This involvement in a fledgling company showed me how a technical idea becomes a marketable product and how to bootstrap using minimal resources. I also freelance as a ghost blogger and content reviewer.

I have widened my interest overtime and my hobbies include writing poetry, amateur mobile photography, reading, and physical training. My poems are put up on my social media page ‚ÄòVIN‚Äôs Scribbles‚Äô.

While most of the students got motivational comments in that column, I was described as ""Passionately Curious"" by my teacher.
While most people ignore the smaller details, I tend to focus on them. Because I think the information lies in the small details. If a field interests me, I am inclined by my mind to know everything about that field. While some will say that I am good at research ""work"", I think it is more than that. I do not think that as ""work"", it is a necessity for my mind. I am passionate about such stuff.
I also tend to be extremely organised and tend to sometimes force this on others, which is, I think is a good ability for a healthy work environment.
I am greatly inspired by Technology and its past. I tend to focus on great leaders in Technology. My biggest inspiration is Steve Jobs. He was a man with a different thinking, inspired millions with his marketing skills and was a tech wiz of his time. I tend to follow his teachings as well as I can. He also pushed the idea of products being intuitive. He hated learning curves and always found ways to adapt the product to the user and not the other way around. This idea stayed in my mind when I first read his biography, and always comes back to me whenever I am writing or designing something.
I love writing. Whether it is an article or an email or even a shopping list. I format my words in a manner that is intuitive and relatable. I do not write in a manner that appeals to everyone, but I tend to write in a manner that everybody understands. 
Part of my motivation to pursue a career in Computer Science is the fact that it combines the future trends of technology with problem solving and aptitude, and I am passionate about both of those fields. I am good at problem solving and a part of that is reflected in my management skills.

2176,Design,Berlin Metropolitan Area,False,2020.0,"User Experience Designer, & Indie Maker. Currently building @MillionFramesAcademy to help aspiring designers become successful.","Do you think movies can change your Life?
Well, it changed mine.

When I was in college, I saw Transformers and got interested in making science fiction short films.
I taught myself filmmaking and software skills to create visual effects.

Luckily, our film won the best editing award at a film festival with 40+ entries.
That award wasn‚Äôt anything huge to celebrate but a small success gave birth to my passion.

I followed my passion and chose to be a creative professional.
Little did I know that watching movies will end up getting me in design, videos, and a creative career.

Today, I am working as a Product Designer in Berlin.
And, building @MillionFramesAcademy, where we are helping designers to be more successful by teaching them new skills.

üî•  7 years of experience as a designer,
üöÄ  Created 30+ digital Products for creatives and filmmakers,
üë©üèª‚Äçüéì  Taught more than 50+ students the art of animation and design,
üéØ  Sold more than 5000 copies of design and video assets,
üéâ  Have a community of over 14K supporters on social media platforms

Since childhood, creativity is something that has been very close to me and it has given me a lot in return. To give back to the community, I started my Instagram handle (@millionframes) to share design content for aspiring designers and creatives.

My mission is to impact as many creatives as I can and inspire them.

I'm learning every day and helping people on my way.

""Add a keyframe every day"" - This is something which I tell myself every new day to become better than yesterday.

Skills-
User Experience (UX) Design, User Interface (UI) Design, Interaction Design, Web Design, Mobile App

My current work is spread across several projects including a Full-Stack ticketing booking application with microservices architecture, designing and working on a back-end architecture for a small start-up idea (OneStep), and participating in international level hackathons, etc.

Besides the activities mentioned above, I try to spend time playing games like Among Us, Candy Crush, Cyberpunk 2077 or watching web series and movies (currently watching The Office and Suits), also I listen to podcasts: Lex Fridman's ""AI Podcast"", JRE and Impaulsive are my daily binges. And last but not the least ""Music"" ya I listen to all sorts of music while I code let it be Hindi, English, Tamil, Spanish etc.

Those are some of my experiences, and I'd love to know more about yours. Shoot me an email at aadarsh-s@outlook.com, and let's chat!

I'm Mohamed Zeeshan, a foreign affairs columnist and author of ‚ÄòFlying Blind: India‚Äôs Quest for Global Leadership‚Äô, published by Penguin Random House in January 2021.

I‚Äôm presently a staff writer for The Diplomat and Editor-in-Chief of Freedom Gazette, an acclaimed policy advocacy site based in India.

I‚Äôm a frequent writer on international affairs and my key areas of interest are Indian foreign policy, international political economy, economic development and global governance. I have previously worked with the global consulting firm Kearney, advised governments in the Middle East on issues of economic reform and state-building, and served with the Indian delegation to the United Nations in New York.

In 2017, I was publicly credited by His Excellency, the Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations, for my creative thinking in strategizing India‚Äôs successful and historic election to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). During that election, India became the first member state in UN history to replace a permanent member of the Security Council in the ICJ. India was elected over the United Kingdom, aided by a majority in the General Assembly.

As a writer, I have been published in over 10 leading international publications in both print and online media. I currently write a fortnightly column for The Diplomat on South Asian affairs. I also write 'The Z Factor' - a monthly Sunday column on national and global issues in the Deccan Herald, one of India's leading print dailies. Other media outlets featuring my opinion essays include The Straits Times, The Sydney Morning Herald, South China Morning Post, The National Interest, Haaretz, The Print, The Wire, ABP News, India Today and The Huffington Post. I have also been interviewed or featured by various international outlets, including The Hindu, The Times of India, HuffPost Live, BBC Radio, Voice of America, SBS Australia and others.

My writing is eclectic and covers the economic and political conditions of various parts of the world. My writing has been recognised and cited by academics and journalists around the world - and my work on reforming the Indian Foreign Service, in particular, has inspired discussion in the Parliament of India.

2292,Publishing,"Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom",False,2019.0,Freelance Science Editor at MogoEdit,"I am a science writer/editor with a multidisciplinary background in Bio-medical sciences. 

I graduated in Biotechnology and interned at the Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, US during my master‚Äôs in Bio-medical Genetics. The work at Mayo gave me chance to author an academic paper, results of which were highlighted in Nature Review. I subsequently worked in the pharmaceutical industry for about 3 years across a spectrum of research ‚Äì from clinical studies to biosimilars. It was during this time that fell in love with writing in science. 

I think writing is an art, and more so when telling a story in science. Although both, ‚Äòstories‚Äô and ‚Äòscience‚Äô have a common thread to spark fascination, one is commonly rooted in imagination, while the other in the empirical facts. It then becomes the job of the science writer to finely balance these and keep the reader in ever awe!

I have considerable experience and understanding of the end-to-end process of scientific communications- from conceptualisation, discussion, refining the study design to writing, reviewing, and publishing documents. I have been involved in writing research manuscripts, documents for regulatory submissions, newsletters for out-reach mediums, and synopsis for global conferences and symposiums.

Last year, I was very fortunate to receive King‚Äôs International Scholarship to pursue a second master‚Äôs in Immunology. Studying at King‚Äôs College, London gave me a chance to capture the excitement of cutting-edge science and horn writing skills, which further carved my inclination to pursue a career in science publishing industry. 

I travel extensively and have a great deal of interest in body-mind science and practices. I also write a blog called www.thecurledtales.com. Although it has just begun, I am loving the idea of connecting with people through written words. As I continue to work as a freelance science editor at Mogo Edits, it gives me immense satisfaction to help the work of non-native English authors reach global audience. 

I enjoy being active on Linkedin, as it inspires me to see the tremendous volume and spectrum of intriguing work that goes around. I am passionate to continue to work in this niche, while being a new mommy to my 4 months old infant. I look forward to networking with people sharing common interests and identify new career opportunities (preferably remote) in the life sciences and publishing industries. Let's connect!

Sound has been an integral part of my life, though I really started listening when I created my first music track. Life has all been much more fulfilling since then. Being a Mechanical Engineer by education, Math and Physics are among my favorite source of food for thought, and Sound is their audible amalgamation.

Storytelling is my area of expertise and the understanding of Rhythm, being an important aspect of it, helps me to contribute to projects from the script stage to the final output. Creating robust work pipelines and structure is my second nature, and this eventually helps in keeping everything organized, which again is one of my dearest obsession.

I have been an active contributor to world's best Education platform, BYJU'S, since 2015, working in collaboration with Disney, to create some amazing movie like videos and games that make students (and parents) fall in love with learning.

As the Creative Director of Sound, I play the role of making sure that anything and everything Audio, right from the Sound Design and Music to Voice (and thus the content) is in its best form for anyone who is listening.

I am proficient in Pro Tools, Cubase/Nuendo, Logic Pro, iZotope RX and use audio plugins from Soundly, u-he, Waves, Native Instruments, SoundToys etc. to get the sound I am looking for. I believe in using the right tool required for the job, so knowing them all in-depth is crucial; and it also helps me in troubleshooting for my peers. Live sound recording with some amazing hardware from Sound Devices, DPA, Ambient, Lectrosonics, TASCAM, Zoom, Rode etc. are in my list of experiences and getting the shot right by communicating well with the director and all relevant stakeholders is something I prefer to do as part of the goal of making things as close to perfect as possible.

At times when I am unable to find the right tools to help me with all this, I prefer building them on my own. The hobbyist coder in me loves to create new audio plugins and web based apps, and the writer side gets the stories written. This has also helped me in a better ideation strategy for the products I work on.

Becoming an Electronics and Computer Engineer ensures me of becoming a pundit of a product as this would impart in me the knowledge of both the hardware and software aspects.

Making the three worlds of academics, sports, and extracurricular link up to develop practical skills is my goal. Participated frequently in basketball, swimming, and cricket at state level. These sports have improved my social effectiveness inculcating adaptability, sense of responsibility, liveliness, and never giving in. Also participation in regional debating and public speaking competitions has made me an extrovert with good oratory skills.

Connecting with people from different walks of life and developing camaraderie gratifies me. Having lived in 8 states across the length of India I have mates from different parts of the nation which has given me understanding about distinct cultures and people. Hence, whenever I meet a new person something common pops up between us in a wink which establishes our relationship.

Adventure drives my survival. Overcoming fears and taking that one leap of faith to enter a new world is what excites me the most. Once I got 14 stitches and lost 5 teeth as a kid doing some activity in the night, thankfully they were temporary teeth.

On a lighter note, I also consider myself as a freelance 'Taste & Texture Maestro' to all the nourishment and sustenance laboratories (food outlets) in and around me.

Using our solution, shippers get the best rates in the market in real time; whereas truckers win more business and are able to fluently organize their supply.

*ROS (Robot Operating System): Developing programs using ROS and C++ language. ‚Ä¢ Operating, managing, and uploading data into GitHub. ‚Ä¢ The working and functionality of Ubuntu 12.04 version (Linux)operating system. 
*Workspace LT for ABB 2400, Adam‚Äôs environment for linkages. ‚Ä¢ Working knowledge of LabView and NI Vision Assistant. ‚Ä¢ MATLAB and SPICE simulation techniques. ‚Ä¢ Basic knowledge in C and C++languages that were used while coding for ROS. 
*A Certified Scrum Master certification dated 8th September,2019 by the Scrum Alliance organization.  *Qualified UGC NET (National Eligibility Test) held in November 2017 with 63.14 as the overall percentile in Electronics Sciences Test. This UGC Net Certification justifies the ability to be a lecturer for professional courses like sciences and engineering.
My passion paved way to a profession of being an Assistant Professor(ad-hoc) at the Sanjay Rungta Group of Institutions, Bhilai, India for Mechatronics Systems Design and Robot Dynamics as elective subjects.  
Since the past year I have been a freelance research paper editor, content editor for small in-home startups and social media pages.
Volunteered at Shri Damodaram Sanjeevaiah High School in Bhilai, India by teaching basic computer skills as well as hobby ideas like gardening, sewing, drawing, reading books to the less privileged children,
I enjoy discussing intellectual contemporary topics as well as burning political issues of my home country-India. Travelled extensively through 5 European countries and most of India and can go on debating at long lengths about future hybrid cars and autonomous vehicles and world cuisines.
My intellectual curiosity drives me to be a lifelong learner and I am undergoing a certification course in SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) as of now.",Institut fran√ßais de M√©canique avanc√©e,pg,group3,Media and Communication,Freelance,opentoopportunitiesatseekingnewpositions,network,Canada,NA,Mechanical Engineering,-0.29609337,-0.3674501,-0.08913231,-0.14547686,-0.31754214,-0.61622804,-0.799207,0.4846898,0.29647255,-0.2812186,-0.34562543,-0.40686503,0.20820904,0.53104585

A year ago, I couldn't have imagined that my Linkedin would be about Content Creation and Video Editing. But here we are.
The most valuable possession that someone could give me is their time. And for you being here and reading this, I am already grateful. 
So this story begins with me not getting selected for the Hindi Literary Association at my college, which compelled me into writing a poem on failure. I ended up making a short video of me reciting that poem which I later uploaded on youtube. And there it was. My first opportunity at creating something which helped me cope and find purpose.
Throughout the locked down period, I created more videos that expressed me and the things I stand for. I learned Video Editing, Sound Design, Cinematography, and many other aspects of Film Making. This process not only proved to be cathartic for me but also helped me channelize my creative energy into something meaningful.
The most captivating thing about Video Creation and Film Making for me is that I can tell any story that I want to tell and I get to chose how I tell it. I can truly be myself in this process. The possibilities, as well as the creative opportunities, are literally endless here. And that is something I thrive on.

My role as an Independent Video Content Creator is to help you spread your message to your clients/ potential clients. Here are the services I offer -

‚Ä¢ Creating and Editing Highly Engaging and Effective Videos for your brand to spread your message

‚Ä¢ Storyboarding for Stragecially Enhanced Marketing

Her current hobbies include art and craft, cooking different styles of cuisine with her family and her lorry full of friends left with no option but to be her ‚Äòguinea pigs‚Äô.  An ardent fan of carnatic music, she was the ‚Äòtwelfth man‚Äô accompanist along with her brother to their mother the ‚Äòman of the match‚Äô whose pitch was A - 6 ‚Äòkattai‚Äô, this would leave her breathless in several household functions.  So she dutifully quit signing to let her mother be in peace and started playing the violin instead. She still has the audacity to torment her violin tutor who puts up with her during the weekends week after week.   

Dreaming and imagining stories caught her during her college days when she had the luxury of free time to read several fictions.  They had to be sleeping partners (commercial termÔÅä) in crime while she was perusing her professional degrees specially Chartered Accountancy when she had to ‚Äòmove a mountain to catch a rat‚Äô.  She was quenching her thirst by participating and scripting the skits for her office cultural events.  However partners in crime wouldn't leave her alone and became ‚Äòlaw of dominance‚Äô in the year 2010. Her head with the brain of a fruit fly was about to explode, she then garnered the courage to discuss this with her friend who encouraged her to pen it down.   Y?me was born thus.

She lives with her Architect husband and two school going brats called daughters in Chennai where she is currently employed.

2893,Information Technology and Services,"Calgary, Alberta, Canada",False,2019.0,"Founder at Talncy | Helping connect Employers, Recruiters and Job Seekers","My MBA and the subsequent job hunt forced me to take a long, hard look at the talent acquisition and job recruitment scenario. I spent frantic hours trying to craft the perfect resume and cover letter, only to have my resume rejected by a machine that was programmed to pick on a few keywords. While these programs help in filtering out unqualified candidates, they couldn't possibly understand the impact of a thoughtfully crafted resume. 

Even if resumes were manually sorted, most employers didn't spend more than an average of 5 seconds glancing through them at pre-screening. This simply meant that the hours spent tailoring a resume and cover letter were mostly futile. Moreover, there was no way 5 seconds was enough time to gauge a candidate's capabilities and job fit. Going through this ordeal firsthand made me realize the disconnect between a recruiter's expectations and a job seeker's lengthy application. There was a huge gap in between that needed to be filled. 

This is when I joined hands with Neil, my Co-founder to create a solution that could not only bridge this gap but also save time and money on both ends of the spectrum. Talncy aims to cut down the time recruiters spend posting for jobs, filtering through resumes, and conducting interviews. On the other end, Talncy is the perfect tool for job seekers who have the right qualifications but lack the marketing ability required to write an eye-catching resume. 

At Talncy, we aim to connect with the right candidates for the role in less than half the time.

I spent frantic hours trying to craft the perfect resume and cover letter, only to have my resume rejected by a machine that was programmed to pick on a few keywords. While these programs help in filtering out unqualified candidates, they couldn't possibly understand the impact of a thoughtfully crafted resume. 

Even if resumes were manually sorted, most employers didn't spend more than an average of 5 seconds glancing through them at pre-screening. This simply meant that the hours spent tailoring a resume and cover letter were mostly futile. Moreover, there was no way 5 seconds was enough time to gauge a candidate's capabilities and job fit. Going through this ordeal firsthand made me realize the disconnect between a recruiter's expectations and a job seeker's lengthy application. There was a huge gap in between that needed to be filled. 

This is when I joined hands with Neil, my Co-founder to create a solution that could not only bridge this gap but also save time and money on both ends of the spectrum. Talncy aims to cut down the time recruiters spend posting for jobs, filtering through resumes, and conducting interviews. On the other end, Talncy is the perfect tool for job seekers who have the right qualifications but lack the marketing ability required to write an eye-catching resume. 

At Talncy, we aim to connect with the right candidates for the role in less than half the time.

2991,Mechanical or Industrial Engineering,"Stockholm County, Sweden",False,2019.0,Development Engineer at Scania Group/ Founder & Chairman KTH Hyperloop ,"Presently, I am working as a system test developer at Scania. The major focus of my work is system-level testing for engine management software. I am also involved in providing comments and feedback for functional development at the system level. This is my first job after completing my Masters at KTH.

Prior to and during my graduation at a KTH, I had a series of practical exposure and experiences of working in innovative and challenging projects, ranging from starting the first hyperloop project of Scandinavia to working on scaled autonomous vehicles, from doing research on alternate fuels to finally writing my master thesis on controlling a double-sided linear induction motor as a proposed method for a hypeloop pod's propulsion.
Further, I have also been a MATLAB student Ambassador for KTH in 2019 and served as Teaching Assistant for Ground Vehicle dynamics course (master level) at KTH.
I was the founder of KTH Hyperloop and served as the team leader for 1.5 years leading a team of 50. We became the first Scandinavian team to enter the top 50 teams for the SpaceX hyperloop pod competition 2019. We represented KTH at SpaceX in 2019 Hyperloop competition. Apart from my role as team lead, I worked, experimented with and implemented the control aspect of the KTH Hyperloop team's propulsion system and braking system.

At KTH, I also had the opportunity of working on autonomous formula 1/10 car, where I designed a control system for steering and speed control to facilitate autonomous navigation. I have also been part of KTH formula student as a FEM analysis member briefly, where I performed dynamic analysis for components that required structural optimization.
During my undergrad, I carried out research on alternate fuels and combustion system of automobiles. The major outcome of the research project is advocating the usage of higher and lower alcohol as an additive to diesel, bio-diesel, and gasoline in an IC engine. I charted a feasibility study of these fuel combinations based on their performance and emission characteristics.
Being an automobile enthusiast as well as a gearhead, I have deep insight into the automotive transmission system.
In summary, I am a research-driven engineer with expertise in control, mechatronics, powertrain, and vehicle dynamics.

Here you are.

I'm not another ordinary developer!

I'm a self-motivated learner who has been flabbergasted with the way technology has taken over the world in recent times.

Having a craze for automation, I'm always looking forward to delving into new opportunities that the world of computer science has to offer.

Being an ardent learner, I do not find myself leaving anything unexplored. And when something catches my attention, it cannot escape me until I let it go learning about it in and out and becoming the best in the business.

I always believe that the ""real"" learning only happens by diving deep into whatever you encounter.

In addition to my persistent attitude, what sets me apart is the fact that I pay great attention to detail in whatever I explore. I recognise small intricacies in the problem posed that others most often miss out on.

Having said that, I always aim for perfection and I think twice (and do my research) before stepping into anything that matters to me. Your landing here is a proof of what I have just said.

As a result of all this, I've been known as the best in whatever I do.

Technology aside, I have a great interest in cricket, playing and keenly following its proceedings.

Thanks for dropping by my profile. Since you are here why not know a little bit about me?

Let me start from the beginning, raised in a middle-class family at a remote location in Uttar Pradesh, I was never exposed to the outside world but I am glad that I wasn't.

The place where I was born and brought up is a mixture of people with different economic backgrounds. I went to a school where I had friends who weren't as fortunate as me economically but we still love each other. 

I have seen what money can do to a person. I have seen people more talented than me bound by the restrictions of society and money.

I went to Delhi for IIT coaching after my 10th, little did I know everything was about to change. I have always been a hard-working individual since childhood. I studied my ass off but couldn't crack JEE Mains at my first attempt.

Ya there was a second attempt too for which I dropped an year. I FAILED again. This was the turning point of my life I would say, I kept doing something that wasn't meant for me. After then I started exploring as much as possible, I would never settle on one thing. Constantly seeking discomfort.

At this point I was out of the rat race already. Now I am living with big dreams in my head and my eyes wide open to face anything that comes my way. 

I have successfully started my own company The MASK Media for which I am proud of myself. I will thrive till I die.

I know I have a heart of an entrepreneur, who is willing to do hard-work so that one day his words matter more than it matters today.

Focusing on the various steps involved in a process was always my primary interest which pushed me to start my carrier as a marketing research analyst where I got real time experience using SQL. After my under graduation I handled a business related to food industry which dealt with collecting information from the market and generating insights for its growth. 
While solving a business problem there would be many factors effecting it, out of which data places a key role. Hereafter encountering many hurdles of this sort I personally felt that I need to equip myself with number of analytical tools by which gives a practical solution to the business problem.
The idea of mixing up ""data"" and ""domain knowledge"" led me to pursue Masters in Business Analytics. Knowledge areas like SQL & R, languages like Python, and data visualization tools like Tableau have equipped me with the right path to work with any data that comes my way. 
With an eye-to-detail, I never missed a thing because every inch of information matters. With a forte for marketing and data analytics, I'd be the right fit for any firm to get their business problems answered!

I chased after the best education I could receive and along the way, comprehended the importance of being close with friends and family. I feel proud in my ability to function with a diverse set of people. Owing to the fact that India is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world, and as I have been living by myself in its various cities in since 2012, I find it easy to socialize with culturally different strata. 

I graduated from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2018, and have worked at KPMG Advisory since then. I gained great insights in conducting clients-businesses, in upskilling myself and in climbing the ladder to my set ambitions. Through my first project, I learned from my manager how to effectively supervise 50 employees staffed at our client site, how to lead and utilize them efficiently as a group. This gave me confidence to work with other clients and lead their teams in achieving both business and functional aims.  I observed through interaction the successful examples of KPMG leadership and client personnel how they balanced professional growth and individual development without compromising on personal life. Apart from these, living by myself and working in the financial hub of India, I was able to grasp how to eliminate the gap that exists between where I am currently, and where I wish to be in the future- Successfully running my own venture.  

At KPMG Infrastructure, Government & Healthcare, I am part of the Digital & Transformation team where we develop, implement and manage government projects in the fields of Information and communication technology. I have had experience in each of these three strands for large scale IT projects across multiple sectors such as healthcare, transport and e-governance. As an Analyst, I am responsible to ensure the smooth operations of my project, client and stakeholder management and the deliverables as well. I support the business development team in drafting proposals for new client projects.

Professionally, I have done this repeatedly at Cuemath; personally, I am a tinkerer, always looking for some new venture to work on. 

Growth is the underlying passion that drives my marketing acumen and entrepreneurial spirit.

Early Learning:
With a foundation in leading and managing a Racing team while graduation helped me learn intricacies of building a strategy and executing it with help of each team member. Those couple of years of experience helped me gain immense learning of following few points -
- Brand Marketing
- Offshore logistics
- Inventory Management
- People Resource Management 

After above experience, I had clearly developed a philosophy - 'Big ideas are dime a dozen. Execution is the key' It is only when you initiate and make it right while in the process.

Professional Experience:
Application of above learning and philosophy in Cuemath has helped me climb the ladder very intuitively. I quickly grasped the market conditions and worked on creating demand with help of team. Focusing on making a repeatable model for growth, we have created a sales engine.

I love working with an energetic team who welcomes new ideas and work coherently to improve efficiency in work culture.

And second: the Challenge of communicating in a way that persuades and convinces consumers always requires optimization‚Äîso you're optimizing for something that is both rational and irrational. I apply the same thinking in marketing that I also apply in leadership because whether you're connecting with consumers or with your team, you're connecting with the fun irrationality of their logic‚ÄîIn order to bring ideas together, influence an outcome, and also optimize and scale for future growth.

3163,Marketing and Advertising,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India",True,2021.0,Business Development Intern | Management Student at ESSEC Business School,"Taking up new challenges, quick learning, working hard towards my goals, and the ability to communicate across levels add strength to my character. 

With over 2 years at Cisco in a software developer role in the networking domain, more specifically the trending SDWAN technology, I have a qualitative and diverse profile that has strengthened my ability to deliver in difficult situations. Adding to my experiences and character is the fact that I hail from a business family. I have interacted with some partners, who have imparted me knowledge in specialised fields - legal, marketing, and distribution. 

I strongly believe in the concept of ‚Äúmutual growth‚Äù. A strong community is only built when there‚Äôs an interaction between people, between ideas and between skills. A successful organisation to me is not the one which has the highest revenue or the highest profits, since these are temporary characteristics. Whereas, an organisation which understands the essence of a great team, leverages individual skills for the greater good, and has a strong foundation is the one that manages to survive obstacles and disruptions in the long run. 

I have always sought a balanced lifestyle. I am a passionate sportsperson. I enjoy playing football and table tennis in particular and have pursued it right from my childhood to the corporate world. I am also an avid movie watcher. Adding to the plethora of experiences I‚Äôve had throughout my life, a stand out phase was my seven year long stint in a boarding school. This experience is something I‚Äôll always be grateful for as it has shaped me into the person I am today and has taught me several life skills that I wouldn‚Äôt have developed otherwise. ‚ÄúNegotiation‚Äù is one such important attribute that has helped me tremendously, both, in the professional setting and in my personal life.

As I see myself grow, and my personality unfold, I know that I want to be a dynamic person, who is willing to adapt at every step in the way of this ever transient world, and add all the useful learnings to my repertoire of skillset.",ESSEC Business School,pg,group1,Business Development ,Fast-Track ,developer,network,India,AS,Management,0.3715994,0.08350182,-0.6612571,-0.572264,-0.2827011,-0.61622804,-0.5150479,0.28258485,-0.5599431,0.092446804,-0.34562543,-0.15667738,-0.22795308,-0.5813182

One particular device which caught my attention since the very beginning was a computer. I would sit for hours in front of it, experimenting with each of the icons displayed on my Windows 98 system. That interest seemed to increase throughout the years and led me to learn python in school and pursue a B.Tech in Computer Science.

As I joined the college at VIT with even greater exposure, I decided to learn, experiment and hone my skills to the fullest. I joined The Hindu Education Plus Club where I did anchoring and video jockeying. To stay connected with the technological industry, I joined CodeChef VIT where I organized hackathons and gained more knowledge about Computer Science. Giving back to society had always been an integral part of me. So I joined Juvenile Care - VIT (NGO) through which I managed to organize free medical camps, handicraft stalls, interschool sports meet for schools and orphanages, cultural days, and various other events. I also got a chance to provide hearing aids to the deaf and dumb children which had a massive impact on their lives and gave me immense satisfaction. As my college years passed by, I observed a decline in the reading habit among students, which led me and my friends to start a book club called The Next Chapter VIT in our college.

With all the experience that I had, I not only learned the different aspects of computer science but also the different opportunities to apply it. In every field that I worked in, I observed how technology could be incorporated to make lives easier. Now I seek a challenging career with a progressive organization that provides an opportunity to capitalize on my technical skills in the field of Computer Science.

3379,Information Technology and Services,"Bangalore Urban, Karnataka, India",False,2019.0,Business Intelligence Engineer - Amazon,"After realizing in college that I cannot take up Counter Strike gaming as a profession, I hung up my  gaming mouse and started my career as a Risk Engineer with AIG Analytics and Services Pvt. Ltd. in Bangalore. My work involved analyzing risks related to manufacturing, non-manufacturing, oil & chemical industries, and provide loss mitigation strategies and recommendations. Here I gained proficiency in risk analysis, loss estimation, loss prevention techniques and risk recommendations.

Working on projects which involved R and SQL piqued my interest in data science and I decided to explore this field. After 2 years at AIG, I joined Amazon's Loss Prevention team as a Data Analyst and have been with the company since. Here I work on mitigating security and operational risks by generating actionable insights through analysis of logistics & customer data.

When not working, I'm either at the gym or playing Counter Strike at home (Old habits die hard). My weekends are usually spent volunteering or enjoying the evening on my Enfield. I have volunteerd for organizations like MAD, Rang De and TFI.

Attached below is a small representation of how I spend my time :)

Here's a bit about how I approach it.

Over the last year of my undergraduate career, I have worked towards developing a core skill set in modern full-stack web development. You can look at my work here: github.com/Itsaadarsh

‚Ä¢ Workflow - VSCode, Git, Github, TypeScript, JavaScript. Terminal, Webpack, WSL

‚Ä¢  Backend - NodeJS, Express, Rest API, GraphQL, Websockets ,PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeORM, Mongoose, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, Unit testing 

‚Ä¢ Frontend - HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, React, Gatsby, Apollo GraphQL, Next.js

My current work is spread across several projects including a Full-Stack ticketing booking application with microservices architecture, designing and working on a back-end architecture for a small start-up idea (OneStep), and participating in international level hackathons, etc.

Besides the activities mentioned above, I try to spend time playing games like Among Us, Candy Crush, Cyberpunk 2077 or watching web series and movies (currently watching The Office and Suits), also I listen to podcasts: Lex Fridman's ""AI Podcast"", JRE and Impaulsive are my daily binges. And last but not the least ""Music"" ya I listen to all sorts of music while I code let it be Hindi, English, Tamil, Spanish etc.

Those are some of my experiences, and I'd love to know more about yours. Shoot me an email at aadarsh-s@outlook.com, and let's chat! Whether it's about something you've read above or something just random, I promise the conversation will be an interesting one. I'm also actively seeking internship/ collaboration opportunities for Summer 2021, so if you have one in mind that you think I could add value to, please do reach out at the email above. Let's create something incredible together!

Have a great day!

Email:-muskan611998jain@gmail.com

My interest in data science and coding is fueled by my passion for Mathematics, logical thinking, a keen interest in technology, and a desire to see and explore their applications in the real world.

I am always curious and always learning.

I have also been learning and exploring open source tools, specifically Git and GitHub, database management systems(DBMS like MySQL). I have knowledge of programming languages- Python, C++, SQL. 

I have recently developed an interest in web development and I am learning tools and technologies accordingly. I am familiar with Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am also familiar with React and Flask.

** Caution: Chest-thumping ahead**

My academic background includes two Graduate Diplomas, in both Finance and Economics from prestigious universities in The United Kingdom, and a Master of Economic Policy from The Australian National University. My undergraduate degree is in Mechanical Engineering, which reveals a strong quantitative background that has supported me in my academic journey. This collection of degrees stand testament to my pursuit of intellectual curiosity, adaptable mindset and ability to traverse steep learning curves. I quickly acclimatise to new environments and welcome opportunities to pick up new skills. 

At the ACT Law Courts and within the Construction Branch at Access Canberra, my recent roles are evidence of my proficiency in detail-oriented and multi-stakeholder environments. My team leaders have applauded my punctuality, self-directing approach, experimentative nature, unabashed questioning to understand fundamentals, voicing my opinion and building trust before seeking additional responsibilities. Don't just take my word for it, I have references to back it up!

As the Information Coordination Officer at Access Canberra, my role involves stakeholder engagement, analysing incoming cases and recognising patterns. This has been a fabulous experience in understanding how regulatory compliance can be achieved through a combination of incentives, enforcement and education. I enjoy the variety in work, access to different areas and levels of expertise, and the vantage point my position offers that allows to me to track the entire journey of the investigation from complaint to resolution. 

I am seeking opportunities, in any and all forms, that will help me develop my awareness regarding my strengths, weaknesses, biases and thought processes.

I am a person who is finding a lot of happiness in learning Stats and ML and I'm hoping to come up with good solutions using it soon.
I have a great affinity towards deep learning and machine learning algorithms and have undergone various courses related to the same. I am also an active participant in Kaggle and I love solving their datasets. I love performing the exploratory analysis as it does the storytelling for me.
At present, I am working on motion planning and controls in robots with Mickey Mouse Labs (Start-up)

3684,E-Learning,"Bangalore Urban, Karnataka, India",False,2015.0,Director - Sound | Disney BYJU'S Early Learn | Audio Apps & Web Developer,"I'm listening.

Sound has been an integral part of my life, though I really started listening when I created my first music track. Life has all been much more fulfilling since then. Being a Mechanical Engineer by education, Math and Physics are among my favorite source of food for thought, and Sound is their audible amalgamation.

Storytelling is my area of expertise and the understanding of Rhythm, being an important aspect of it, helps me to contribute to projects from the script stage to the final output. Creating robust work pipelines and structure is my second nature, and this eventually helps in keeping everything organized, which again is one of my dearest obsession.

I have been an active contributor to world's best Education platform, BYJU'S, since 2015, working in collaboration with Disney, to create some amazing movie like videos and games that make students (and parents) fall in love with learning.

As the Creative Director of Sound, I play the role of making sure that anything and everything Audio, right from the Sound Design and Music to Voice (and thus the content) is in its best form for anyone who is listening.

I am proficient in Pro Tools, Cubase/Nuendo, Logic Pro, iZotope RX and use audio plugins from Soundly, u-he, Waves, Native Instruments, SoundToys etc. to get the sound I am looking for. I believe in using the right tool required for the job, so knowing them all in-depth is crucial; and it also helps me in troubleshooting for my peers. Live sound recording with some amazing hardware from Sound Devices, DPA, Ambient, Lectrosonics, TASCAM, Zoom, Rode etc. are in my list of experiences and getting the shot right by communicating well with the director and all relevant stakeholders is something I prefer to do as part of the goal of making things as close to perfect as possible.

At times when I am unable to find the right tools to help me with all this, I prefer building them on my own. The hobbyist coder in me loves to create new audio plugins and web based apps, and the writer side gets the stories written. This has also helped me in a better ideation strategy for the products I work on.

Btw, if you're still reading, do let me know what's your favorite sound in the world. And if you want, let's talk about it.

To be honest, when I was in college, the girl I dated supported Liverpool and that's how I began to support the club. 4 years forward, this club stayed and with developed interest, I began to study the history of the LFC. Knowledge of football, clubs, and different leagues helped me significantly after I graduated from college, moved cities, and started my professional career with Uber.

Getting into the character of an employee, I realized - In this company, there are folks coming in from different age groups and since football is constant across age groups, it became a lever for a great icebreaker that led to a smooth flow of conversation and that led to instant bond among employees.

Cut to - I survived the impact of the pandemic and continue to work with Uber for over 4 years now - gained experience in project management, program/ people management, operations, strategy & planning, and customer service - all these contributed to my role as Project Delivery Lead for India SA Region at Uber.

Most interesting part of my intern was the cost control and management which plays a vital role in a construction activity.

Developing the App and launching it to the world, is just the first step of your goal.  What you need is constant support, analytics, business intelligent, marketing strategy suggestions based on analytics to be able to effectively reach you goal. 

What AppDAS offers is a App development as a service, so you start your app with a low upfront cost, and a monthly service cost. This would enable you to make sure that the application developer is more of a partner in your business process than a one time vendor, who develops the app that you need for a lump sum price, and has no interest in supporting or helping you to increase the efficiency of your business through the app.

At AppDAS we believe our growth should be linked to the growth of our customers.  We believe in being partners to our clients, where we want to support through out their goals for their app.

Application Development as a service is an unique concept conceptualised by Spinta Digital Inc. 

Application Development for your business, and bringing mobility solutions in to your business is an expensive affair.  Developing the App and launching it to the world, is just the first step of your goal.  What you need is constant support, analytics, business intelligent, marketing strategy suggestions based on analytics to be able to effectively reach you goal. 

What AppDAS offers is a App development as a service, so you start your app with a low upfront cost, and a monthly service cost. This would enable you to make sure that the application developer is more of a partner in your business process than a one time vendor, who develops the app that you need for a lump sum price, and has no interest in supporting or helping you to increase the efficiency of your business through the app.

At AppDAS we believe our growth should be linked to the growth of our customers.  We believe in being partners to our clients, where we want to support through out their goals for their app. 

We have a strong team with abundance of experience in developing apps for some of the leading companies across continents.

Prior to my MBA, I acquired a Masters' in Computer Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and held leadership positions within product and research groups in the smartphone industry (Qualcomm, Samsung R&D) as a computer architect. I was fortunate to witness the explosive growth of the smartphone and tablet markets first-hand and was a member of high visibility + growth teams that collectively delivered over 1 Billion chips to users. I have a strong track record of constraint-driven problem solving, delivering to customers under tight deadlines, analyzing and drawing insights from massive data sets and performing competitive analysis. 

I enjoy volunteering, in particular with K-12 students interested in STEM careers and women's empowerment programs. I am always interested in new opportunities in this area.

I am a graduate student at Columbia University NY, an engineer, and an aspiring product/program manager.

Previously, I worked at Capillary Technologies as a Product Manager Intern to solve the toughest problems in eCommerce and CRM. Prior to my experience at Capillary, I interned in multiple analytics roles across domains such as marketing, technology, and finance. This includes my business analytics internship at Leo Burnett India, Software Developer / Analytics Internship at Nokia, and Sterling Software. 

I‚Äôve always been captivated about using technology to scale up products. I founded a student organization in my sophomore year through which I established a platform for engineering students to build tech products. The organization grew exponentially within a year and received the best student chapter award by IEEE. I was also awarded the prestigious Richard E. Merwin Award for my contributions to the student community.

I enjoy taking up responsibilities and ownership of tasks. I‚Äôve been a member and coordinator of various societies throughout my undergrad, and each one of those experiences has helped me shape who I am.

I would love to get in touch with you - we can talk about anything pertaining to products, technology, business, or startups!

- The concept of consumer logic and how rational yet irrational it can be. 
- The challenge of communicating in a way that persuades and convinces consumers always requires optimization‚Äîso you're optimizing for something that is both rational and irrational.

In this world of demand and customers: I create, scale, and optimize business portfolios. I do this by generating revenue through digital products and services. To accomplish this, I focus on audience and business needs, understanding product mechanics, tracking metrics and dissecting performance, and championing product improvements.

I have built and grown digital products for Nationwide Insurance, AXA Asia, Government of Andhra Pradesh, Shipping ministry of India, Paulig Coffee, and Lassila & Tikanoja. One of my memorable projects was building the port community digital platform for Indian Maritime trade. Partly because of that product, India improved its ease of doing business from 100 to 77 in 2018. Seeing digital products easing bottlenecks and helping people is what I work for!

My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself:

I have high Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
- I bring people together. Leadership, employees, vendors, customers.
- I value my team and make sure that the team keeps skilling as needed

I can create scale and optimize digital products:
- Key Account Management: I put the customer at the center of all that I do.
- I bridge digital product management and creative strategies
- Plan features in smaller sprints keeping in mind macro changes in markets
- Manage high-quality product roadmaps based on vision and strategy

I enable product sales and user acquisition:
- I monitor success and usage criteria and developing new user stories to drive product improvement
- Create campaigns and programs to increase digital adoption by customers

When I am not working, I am either out cycling somewhere, running a marathon, or learning to play the blues! I also collaborate with All hands and Hearts, a US-based volunteer organization.

I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives.

At Ford Motor Company, I was a Design Assurance Engineer responsible for driving continuous improvement for the Ford brand to deliver top quality products and services. 

My key task was to manage engineering-processes by following an integrative approach with Design and Manufacturing, Vehicle Engineering and Procurement teams, taking their feedback and working with the product team to refine our products by applying lean manufacturing strategies. I also mentored Engineering Teams on pre-production phase, as a ‚ÄòFailure Mode Avoidance‚Äô coach. 

In my last role, I handled pre-program development, translating competitive trends and customer expectations into vehicle attribute performance, architecture and features. Till date, I have led cross-functional teams, as part of 20 Six-Sigma Projects, across different functions, to determine industry best practices in resolving in-plant issues, resulting in net cost savings of US $5 million.

I am a Ford-Certified Six Sigma Black Belt, ASQ-Certified Quality Engineer and IBM-Certified Data Science Professional. I have recently obtained a Digital Marketing Certification from Google and wish to explore Strategy and Marketing based roles post MBA. 

Outside of work, I am on a mission to encourage old and new drivers to use effective driving tips and techniques leading to safe, economic and eco-friendly driving. I have coached 60,000 people, on various aspects of road safety and responsible driving, Additionally, I have undertaken Six Sigma problem solving projects on ‚ÄòAir-bag deployment‚Äô and ‚ÄòBrake pedal sensitivity‚Äô and have collaborated with multiple stakeholders on designing road-safety systems and crash attenuators.

I am an experienced martial-artist and have the rare distinction of holding a Black Belt grade in 'Shotokan Karate' and 'Taekwondo' . I won the Bronze medal in 'South-East Asian Karate Championships' and the Gold medal in the Nationals. Recently, I discovered my love for biking and hop-on to my Enfield whenever I find time.

Product Manager since 2019 in SAP SuccessFactors People Analytics area. The major challenge was to ensure the timely launch of the product by first getting the left-out work completed. It was challenging, as while I was learning the What & Why of the product, the need of the hour was to focus more on the When part. The initial juggling was not so smooth but was able to manage to take the product into BETA release. I got an opportunity to manage the BETA program which proved to be tremendously beneficial in getting real-time customer feedback. For some of the feedback, we went back to the white-board & made adjustments before we launched our product to a wider customer base. We were finally able to roll-out the product in early 2020 to wider audience. 

Currently, focusing mainly on customer adoption & growth of the product along with further product features development.

Though we are complex, mysterious beings who are often difficult to each other, I feel storytelling reminds us we‚Äôre all the same.

My story is one of a data explorer. 

Back in university, I conducted open surveys with help of my batch mates and performed statistical analysis on the responses as I was curious to know if there was any link between the choice of course taken on campus and factors such as the day on which classes were scheduled, the distance of the student's hostel from relevant classroom,  branch of the student, the sex ratio of that specific branch, etc.

During my professional spell at Accenture, I wanted to know we could optimize productivity as a team by tracking and understanding our working patterns. I was glad that using my data analysis skills in excel and R, I was able to assist automation team in building interactive dashboards that helped us do the same. This ultimately translated to a 30% increase in team productivity.

While working as a Data Analyst at Flipkart,
I solved complex supply chain optimization problems using statistical analysis , understood the nitty gritty of e-commerce business and worked on improving key performance indicators such as delivery speed, customer satisfaction index, transport vehicle utilisation and many more.

Right now, I'm building my  portfolio of skills as I strongly intend to grow as a data scientist who can contribute and add value to organizations with a mission statement.
